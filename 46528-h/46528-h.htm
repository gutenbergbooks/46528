<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>THE MOONLIGHT RUSH.</small></h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It’s a way we have at Old Concord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s a way we have at Old Concord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It’s a way we have at Old Concord;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To drive dull care away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One moonlight evening in the early spring,
under a cloudless sky, a party of twelve Concord
College Sophomores sang these lines as they
marched up the street toward the college
grounds. They were young, all in a happy
mood; they kept step to the strokes of their
canes on the pavement, and swung along with
vigor and elasticity, making the air throb with
their rollicking songs.</p>

<p>Parmenter was with them. His was the tenor
voice that rang out with such strength and clearness
above the others. He was the leader of
his class; in favor with the faculty, popular with
his fellows, a welcome guest at any gathering.</p>

<p>The party passed on up the hill, through the
college gate and along the terrace, still singing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
They halted in front of Professor Samuel Lee’s
residence, faced toward it and began a new
song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here’s to Sammy Lee, drink it down, drink it down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to Sammy Lee, drink it down, drink it down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to Sammy Lee, and a right good fellow he;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Drink it down, drink it down,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Drink it down, down, down,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Balm of Gilead, Gilead;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Balm of Gilead, Gilead;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Balm of Gil-e-ad;<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Way down on the Bingo farm.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last words were hardly out of the
mouths of the singers before the door of the
house was opened, and from the square of light
thus made, the old professor himself stepped
out upon the porch.</p>

<p>“Thank you, young gentlemen,” he said,
pleasantly. “This is a glorious night for a
song. I’ve heard students sing along this terrace
for twenty years and more, and I never
liked their songs better than I do to-night.
The music of them grows upon me always.
Thank you again, gentlemen, and good-night!”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, Sammy!” shouted one
irrepressible from the group, while all the rest
responded with a hearty “Good-night!”</p>

<p>No one intended to be disrespectful to Professor
Lee. The use of his nickname was
meant as a mark of affection, and he understood
it so. But in the classroom his dignity was
never trespassed upon. There were one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
good stories handed down from class to class,
narrating the just fate that befell audacious
students of the past who had ventured to be
rude to “Sammy.” These possibly apocryphal
incidents made him more popular, and in private
he was the trusted friend of every student
at Concord College.</p>

<p>Besides that, he had a boy of his own—an
only child, with whom he kept in close sympathy,
and in whom the best and brightest of
all his hopes were centered. This boy, Charley,
was a member of the Sophomore Class. He
was a bright, lovable, popular fellow, impetuous,
perhaps somewhat lacking in stability, but
likely to become a worthy if not a brilliant man.</p>

<p>He came out now upon the porch, just as his
father turned to go in, and stood for a moment
peering into the group on the walk as if trying
to make out the identity of the persons who
composed it. He was no sooner seen by his
classmates than another song broke from their
lips:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here’s to Sammy’s son, bring him down, bring him down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to Sammy’s son, bring him down, bring him down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here’s to Sammy’s son, for he’s always full of fun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring him down, bring him down, bring him down, down, down, down.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Young Lee recognized the tenor voice in a
moment. He and Parmenter were bosom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
friends. Their companions had long ago dubbed
them Damon and Pythias.</p>

<p>“Hello, Fred!” cried Lee, “are you there?
Hello, fellows! Is there room for me?”</p>

<p>“Always room for one more,” was the reply.
“Move up, please! Move up now and let the
gentleman aboard! Why don’t you help him
on, Freddie? Help him on; he’s yours.”</p>

<p>There was more good-natured bantering.
Then the party faced toward the campus and
started on, singing a good-night song to Professor
Lee:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Good-night, Sammy! Good-night, Sammy! Good-night, Sammy!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">We’re going to leave you now.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Merrily we roll along<br /></span>
<span class="i8">O’er the deep blue sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The steps sounded in unison, the heavy canes
beat time, and back from the campus, mellowed
by the growing distance, came still the music
of the song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet dreams, Sammy! Sweet dreams, Sammy!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sweet dreams, Sammy!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We’re going to leave you now.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Through a half-open window the words came
floating softly into the ears of Professor Lee,
and he smiled as he thought of the real affection
and seeming irreverence of the boys. Though
his hair was white with years, his heart was
very youthful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>He liked young men, and sympathized with
them. He entered heartily into both their work
and play. He enjoyed their fun, approved of
their games, and was the champion of athletics
at Concord. But the doubtful sport of hazing
he detested with his whole soul, and did not
hesitate to say so.</p>

<p>Every one was aware of his feeling on this
subject, but there were few who knew why it
was so deep. In a distant city, confined in an
asylum for the insane, Professor Lee’s only
brother had lived for years, an imbecile. His
condition was the direct result of injuries received
at the hands of college hazers in his youth.</p>

<p>With this sorrow shadowing his life, it is not
strange that hazing was an object of horror and
hatred in Professor Lee’s thoughts.</p>

<p>The party of students, now headed by Parmenter
and Lee, passed on across the campus,
still singing. From the shadows of North College
the tall figure of a young man emerged and
came toward them. In the bright moonlight he
was recognized at once as Van Loan, a man who
had recently entered the Freshman class, coming
from another college.</p>

<p>He had brought with him a reputation for
mental ability and physical strength that gave
him at once a prominent position among his
fellows. But he was inordinately vain. He did
not hesitate to boast of his wealth, of his aristocratic
lineage, and of his superior attainments.</p>

<p>There is no community so thoroughly democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
as a community of students; and while
Van Loan’s real ability met with the respect it
deserved, his vanity and arrogance made him obnoxious.</p>

<p>To-night he was dressed in the height of fashion.
His costly clothes were a perfect fit. But
the articles of ornament and apparel which particularly
attracted the attention of the Sophomores
who approached him were his high silk
hat and his heavy cane.</p>

<p>It was an unwritten law among the students
at Concord College that Freshmen should not
wear silk hats or carry canes before reaching their
third term. Any violation of this law was sure
to bring on a class rush, in which the winning
side secured and preserved the offensive articles
of costume as trophies and emblems of their
victory.</p>

<p>Yet here was a Freshman, in the midst of the
second term, approaching a group of Sophomores
with a cane in his hand and a silk hat on his
head! Apparently he saw danger ahead of
him, for he stopped a moment.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked some one in the group,
as they came up to Van Loan.</p>

<p>“It must be Wilson’s dummy come to life,”
replied another. Wilson was the college tailor.</p>

<p>Van Loan heard these uncomplimentary remarks,
and his face flushed with anger. He
started boldly on, turning to the right as if to
pass by the group. But half a dozen Sophomores
intercepted him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you fellows mean by this impertinence?”
he asked, curtly.</p>

<p>“We mean,” replied Parmenter, “that Freshmen
are not yet allowed to carry sticks or wear
‘plugs.’ As you came here recently, from a one-horse
college, perhaps you were not aware of
this rule. If not, we shall be pleased to escort
you to your room, where you can lay these highly
objectionable articles of apparel away, and let
them grow with your growth until it is time for
you to wear them. But if you have knowingly
and deliberately violated our rule, we—”</p>

<p>“What business is it of yours what I carry or
wear?” interrupted Van Loan, hotly. “Stand
aside and let me pass, or some one will get
hurt!”</p>

<p>“Having declined our offer to escort you to
your room,” continued Parmenter, coolly, “we
shall be obliged to ask you to deliver up to us
at once the articles I have named.”</p>

<p>“You shall not have them!” replied Van Loan,
savagely. “I dare any one of you to come
and get them. I dare all of you to take them
away! You are cowards and bullies, every one
of you!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the Sophomores approached
him he backed out into the road, retreating steadily
until he came to the edge of a muddy pool
of water left by the melting snows.</p>

<p>“You are robbers!” he shouted, fiercely.
“What right have you to stop a gentleman in
the public road and demand his property?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“The right that might makes,” came the quick
reply from some one in the group.</p>

<p>The Sophomores were gradually encircling
their victim. Van Loan glanced about him nervously,
and clutched his cane as if to make ready
for action.</p>

<p>“Give them up peaceably, and we won’t even
disturb the part in your hair,” said some one.</p>

<p>“And be quick about it, too,” said another,
“for tempus is fast fugiting.”</p>

<p>Another body of students, scenting sport and
trouble from afar, was rapidly approaching from
the direction of South College. The circle
about Van Loan was completed and contracting.
He saw that his only hope lay in holding his
enemies at bay until help should arrive from his
own classmen. Yet he could not face all ways
at once.</p>

<p>“Come, here’s the last word,” said Robinson,
who recognized the men now bearing down on
them as members of the Freshman class; “will
you surrender the obnoxious articles peaceably,
or won’t you?”</p>

<p>Van Loan, too, saw that assistance was at
hand, and his courage increased accordingly.</p>

<p>“Never!” he shouted. “These things are
mine, and I’ll keep them, and the first man that
lays his hands on them or me, I’ll break his—”</p>

<p>What it was that Van Loan would have
broken, no one ever knew; for Parmenter, advancing
quickly to his side, tripped him so suddenly
and dexterously that he measured his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
full length in the shallow, muddy pool into which
he had been too dainty to step.</p>

<p>In the same instant Lee snatched the cane
from his grasp, and Robinson caught the silk
hat as it fell.</p>

<p>But the victory was short-lived. Van Loan’s
assailants turned with their trophies only to find
themselves face to face with and outnumbered
by a party of Van Loan’s classmates, who plunged
at once to the rescue.</p>

<p>Then the rush was on. Up from the midst
of the struggling mass came the class call of the
Sophomores. It was followed at once by the
class cry of the Freshmen. Soon the campus
was alive with students hurrying singly and in
groups toward the scene of the conflict.</p>

<p>Freshmen and Sophomores darted at once into
the thick of the fight, while the Juniors and Seniors,
moving about on the outskirts of the battleground,
cheered and encouraged alternately the
contending factions.</p>

<p>Van Loan had struggled to his feet as the
center of battle moved away from him, and
looked down ruefully and in speechless anger at
his soiled and dripping garments.</p>

<p>“Don’t look very pretty, do they?” said a
smiling Junior who stood by.</p>

<p>The victim of the drenching did not deign a
reply. He jerked off his coat, and began wringing
the water from it. Suddenly he asked:
“Who was it, anyway? What coward threw
me down?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“A young fellow by the name of Parmenter,”
was the answer; “a first-class all-around athlete.
I shall be happy to introduce you to him at some
more opportune moment.”</p>

<p>Van Loan did not relish the bantering tone
of his informant; and muttering something more
about cowards and bullies, he turned savagely
on his heel, and started across the campus
toward his room.</p>

<p>But a second thought appeared to come to
him; for in the next moment he swung himself
quickly about and ran, as fast as his heavy garments
would permit him to, toward the crowd
that was still struggling over his hat and cane.</p>

<p>He forced his way desperately into the center
of the group and through it, looking for Parmenter,
his wet clothing like ice upon his body,
but a fire of hate raging in his heart.</p>

<p>It was not long before Van Loan’s hat was in
shreds; but the cane, heavy and tough, resisted
all the violence brought to bear upon it, and remained
unbroken. Wherever it was, there
was the center of the fight. The struggling
group about it moved here and there, now swiftly,
now slowly, swaying and parting, meeting and
clinging, the dark mass looking from a distance,
in the moonlight, like some huge monster twisting
and writhing in pain.</p>

<p>Hats were lost and trampled upon. Coats were
torn from the backs of their owners, clothes were
rent and ruined—everywhere the campus was
strewn with the débris of personal belongings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Shifting back and forth by degrees, the surging
mob finally reached a point in the driveway
near the corner of South College.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the mass being rent by some swift
convulsion, Parmenter darted from the midst
and ran rapidly along the drive toward the main
entrance to the building. He held Van Loan’s
cane in his hand. In an instant Van Loan was
at his heels, with Lee a good third.</p>

<p>From the crowd that pressed forward toward
them came hoarse shouts of encouragement and
wild yells of anticipated victory. The non-combatants
who stood by joined in the cheers, and
hurried on after the racers.</p>

<p>Those who watched closely saw that Parmenter,
notwithstanding the swiftness of his gait,
limped as if he had been hurt. They saw, too,
that Van Loan was gaining on him; and more
than one person, marking the look of desperate
desire in Van Loan’s face, feared that it meant
serious mischief.</p>

<p>When Parmenter reached the stone pavement
in front of the buildings Van Loan was near
enough to grasp him, but he did not do so. He
kept on until pursuer and pursued were side by
side; then turning sharply and suddenly, he
thrust out his foot and struck Parmenter’s feet
from under him. The young man was hurled
headlong to the pavement.</p>

<p>He fell on his side and shoulder. The blow
of his fall was heard above the storm of shouts
and cheers that followed him. In an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Van Loan had seized the cane, and flourished it
for a second in heroic attitude above the prostrate
body of his victim. Then finding Lee almost
within touch, he turned and ran with it
into an open doorway of South College.</p>

<p>But Lee did not follow him; he stopped
where Parmenter lay in the moonlight, white-faced,
limp, and unconscious, with flowing blood
staining the pavement under his head.</p>

<p>“He’s hurt!” cried Lee, frightened at his
friend’s appearance, and bending over him in
deep anxiety. “He’s hurt! Maybe the brute
has killed him! Here, give us a lift; let’s carry
him in! Rob, run for Doctor Park—run!”</p>

<p>The crowd, suddenly quieted, pressed forward
toward the point where Parmenter lay. Half
a dozen of his classmen had already lifted him
in their arms, and a moment later they were
carrying him, hurt, helpless, still unconscious,
across the moonlit campus to his room.</p>

<p>But the fight was won. Van Loan’s stroke,
cruel and revengeful though it was, had placed
victory in the hands of the Freshmen. Henceforth
every man in the class was entitled, by
virtue of the time-honored student law, to wear
a high hat and carry a cane whenever and wherever
he might choose to do so.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>THE GAMMA QUESTERS.</small></h2>


<p>Parmenter recovered consciousness soon
after he was carried to his room, after being
thrown so viciously by Van Loan; but when
the college physician came he declared that
there was a fracture of the right clavicle.</p>

<p>There was also a deep scalp wound where
Parmenter’s head had struck on a sharp edge
of the stone pavement, and this required stitching
and dressing.</p>

<p>When the bathing and bandaging and plastering
had been done, the injured man was
thoroughly exhausted, and weak from loss of
blood. His bosom friend, Charley Lee, remained
to care for him through the night.</p>

<p>Next morning Parmenter awoke, refreshed
and comfortable. By and by the doctor came.
Parmenter gave him hardly time to take off his
overcoat before he inquired,</p>

<p>“How long will it be, doctor, before I shall
have the free use of my arm?”</p>

<p>“Oh, three or four weeks,” was the reply.
“These simple fractures of the clavicle are of
no great consequence. They heal up very
quickly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Parmenter’s face fell. Three or four weeks!
His injury might indeed have been of no great
consequence from the surgeon’s point of view,
but to him it was a serious matter. It was
likely to block his way to the prize stage.</p>

<p>At Concord College one evening of Commencement
week was devoted to the delivery
of orations by Juniors and Sophomores in competition
for prizes. Six competitors were selected
from each class at a trial contest held
about three months before Commencement. To
be appointed to the prize stage was a marked
honor, and one which Parmenter greatly coveted.
He had worked for it for months.</p>

<p>The trial speaking was to take place in the
college chapel on the following Friday; and
here he was, and would be for weeks, with a
broken collar-bone, and his right arm in a sling!</p>

<p>When Lee came back from breakfast, Parmenter
exclaimed with a groan,</p>

<p>“It’s all up, Charley!”</p>

<p>“What’s all up?” asked Lee, advancing in
alarm to the bed.</p>

<p>“Why, the prize stage! The doctor says I
can’t use my arm for a month, and here’s the
trial speaking coming on next Friday!”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” replied Lee, sinking
into a chair. “It is a bad business, that’s
so.” After a minute he added, “But your voice
will be all right, Fred; you can have that as
clear as a bell.”</p>

<p>“My voice! What good is that to me? Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I make gestures with my voice? How can a
man do anything with his arm in a sling and
his shoulders bound up as if he were a mummy?”</p>

<p>Parmenter was excited. He felt that hitherto
his success on the platform had been largely due
to the training he had had in what is called
“presence” and his skill in gestures. That
effect would now be totally destroyed.</p>

<p>“You might learn to use your left arm,” suggested
Lee, as a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>“Bah! You know better than that, Charley.
I’m out, that’s all. There’s only one redeeming
feature about the whole business; and that is,
that you’ll carry off first prize now for all the
trouble I shall give you.”</p>

<p>For a minute Lee was at a loss for an answer.
He also was a candidate for the prize stage.
They had agreed that each was to strive to obtain
the honor to the best of his ability; but
the rivalry was so friendly that neither would
have accepted an appointment at the expense
of the other. At the same time, it would have
been a great pleasure to either to have the other
carry off the prize.</p>

<p>After a while Lee said, casting his eyes down
on his friend’s bandaged shoulder and plastered
head:</p>

<p>“That was a cowardly thing for Van Loan
to do, wasn’t it? Dangerous, too. Why, just
think of it! It might have cracked your skull!”</p>

<p>“Pity it hadn’t!” growled Parmenter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
“Then there’d have been no question about
my being an idiot. As it is—well, I’ve two
years in which to get even with him. I think
I can manage to make it up to him in that
time.”</p>

<p>After a minute he added, “Did the Freshies
carry sticks this morning, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Every one of ’em,” said Lee. “They all
went down town last night after the row, and
what canes they couldn’t raise money enough to
buy, they begged or borrowed. They’re tremendously
proud and joyous this morning—especially
Van Loan. He thinks he’s the biggest
toad in the puddle now, sure.”</p>

<p>Parmenter turned savagely toward the wall,
and winced with the pain the movement caused
him; but he said nothing. After a little Lee
reverted to the prize-speaking contest. He had
been thinking about it all the time.</p>

<p>“Don’t be discouraged about that prize-speaking,
Fred,” he said. “Go ahead with it.
Put it through. Never mind the gestures.
They’re only a useless ornament, anyway.
Why, you know—what’s his name?—that
great orator, you remember; he never used gestures;
disdained ’em; laid himself out on voice
and expression, you know, and swayed the
hearts of multitudes by his eloquent and thrilling—”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell that to the marines! Here, I want
to get up. Give me a lift, will you, Charley?
and help me on with my clothes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Parmenter had no great faith in the possibility
of successful oratory without gestures,
but Lee’s idea struck him as worth considering,
after all; and the more he thought about it, the
more he was inclined toward it.</p>

<p>He resumed the private rehearsals of his oration.
He and Lee always rehearsed together,
profiting by each other’s friendly criticism; but
now Lee redoubled his efforts to make his
friend’s work perfect and successful.</p>

<p>It was awkward to Parmenter at first to attempt
to deliver his most telling sentences with
his right arm bound to his side, so instinctive
had gesturing become to him; but diligent
study, persistent practice, and the judicious advice
of his friendly critic helped him to overcome
to a great extent that one difficulty.
When on the following Friday he took his
place before the judges, it was with no small
degree of confidence in his success.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning the list containing the
names of the fortunate six was posted on the
bulletin board near the chapel entrance. Parmenter’s
name was upon it.</p>

<p>Lee caught sight of it first, and looking no
further in the list, started at a full run across
the campus to deliver the news to his friend.</p>

<p>“Fred, it’s there!” he cried, bursting into
Parmenter’s room like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>“What’s where?” asked Parmenter, gruffly.</p>

<p>“Your name—on the bulletin—prize speaking—no
right arm—great victory—whoop!
Give us your hand!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Lee made a dash for his friend’s right hand,
and in another second would have given it a
vigorous shake.</p>

<p>“Oh, hold! halt! fire! murder! Hang it,
man, that’s my cracked shoulder!” exclaimed
Parmenter, backing away.</p>

<p>“Fred, forgive me! Did I hurt you? No?
In the joyful exuberance of my emotion the
swelling tide of feeling overran its bounds and
came—”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother the swelling tide! I’m obliged
to you for the news, though. Here, take the
other hand; that’s it! I thought I could convince
’em that a man can speak sometimes with
his right arm strapped fast to his ribs. You’re
sure there’s no mistake about it, Charley?”</p>

<p>“Your name is there! I saw it with my own
eyes; these eyes that otherwise had wept most
bitter tears of vain regret, and poured their—”</p>

<p>“Bah! Stop right there! Well, I’m ready to
recover now. I’m ready—say, Charley, look
here! What about yourself? You took an appointment,
too, didn’t you? Your name’s on the
list, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Lee stood for a moment without answering,
the look of puzzled surprise on his handsome
face breaking into one of amusement, and ending
in a broad smile.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one on me,” he said finally, as
if partly ashamed of his remissness toward himself.
“I forgot to look.”</p>

<p>“Forgot to look! Why, you saw my name!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
You couldn’t have helped seeing yours if it had
been there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—but you see I wasn’t looking for
mine—I didn’t—”</p>

<p>“Well, you are the—Charley Lee, you’re
the best fellow in the world—positively the
very best!”</p>

<p>Parmenter grasped Lee’s hand again, and
tears came into his eyes. It was seldom he
displayed so much emotion; but his friend’s
unselfishness touched him deeply.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said, quietly, “let’s go over and
see about the name of Charles Lee. It’s high
time for some one to take an interest in that.”</p>

<p>He picked up his hat, took his friend’s arm,
and they started to leave the room; but at the
threshold they met Robinson, also one of the
appointees, who told them that Lee’s name was
on the list. Then there were general rejoicings
and congratulations.</p>

<p>Lee executed a breakdown very skillfully,
landing finally on Parmenter’s table, from which
elevation he proceeded to deliver a mock oration.</p>

<p>The noise and confusion drew three or four
other Sophomores into the room; and when
Lee had been dragged down and quieted, the
conversation turned from the prize stage to
Parmenter’s shoulder, and from Parmenter’s
shoulder to Freshman Van Loan.</p>

<p>“He thinks he won the fight,” said one of
the young men. “He takes all the credit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
himself, every bit of it. Brags about it without
ceasing. You couldn’t touch him with a
ten-foot pole before the rush; the Atlantic
cable wouldn’t reach to him now.”</p>

<p>“Some fellow told him the other day,” added
another member of the group, “that unless he
stopped his everlasting boasting, the Gamma
Questers might do him the honor to call on
him.”</p>

<p>“What did he say to that?” asked Robinson.</p>

<p>“Said he’d be pleased to see ’em. Said he’d
make it interesting for ’em. Said they’d better
have a surgeon in readiness to wait on ’em
when he got through with ’em. Said he should
particularly enjoy meeting his friend Parmenter
under such auspices.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s dead set against you, Parmenter,”
cried another. “He hasn’t forgiven nor forgotten
that mud-bath yet. He says the collar-bone
business was only part payment, and that the
remaining installments will be fully as delightful
as the first one was.”</p>

<p>For a minute no one spoke. Robinson was
looking around the room, scanning intently
each man’s face. Finally he said:</p>

<p>“Boys, if there’s any one here who don’t believe
in hazing under proper circumstances will
he have the goodness to retire?”</p>

<p>No one stirred.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Parmenter,” continued Robinson,
“we don’t want to drive you from your
room; we will go elsewhere if you wish it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Parmenter did not at once reply. He rose,
went to the door and locked it, closed the ventilator
over the door, and returned and sat
down. Then he said, “Go on with the story.”</p>

<p>What took place behind that closed and
locked door none but the seven who were there,
and the seven who were afterward taken into
the company, ever knew.</p>

<p>The time was when the raids of the Gamma
Questers, as hazing parties were called at Concord
College, were of frequent occurrence.
But under the severely repressive policy of
the faculty, aided by a growing feeling among
upper classmen against the barbarous and unmanly
custom, the practice had nearly died out.
There were scarcely a dozen men in the college
who remembered the last instance of it.</p>

<p>Yet there is no doubt that a chapter of the
Gamma Questers was organized that day in
Parmenter’s room; neither is there any doubt
that it selected Freshman Van Loan as an unwilling
candidate for admission and initiation.</p>

<p>Under the excitement and impulse of the
moment Lee was the readiest to advocate this
form of retribution, and the most fertile in devising
plans to carry it out. But a few days
later he came to Parmenter with a cloud on
his face and a burden on his mind.</p>

<p>“It’s about that Van Loan business,” he explained.
“I’m half sorry I agreed to go into it.
You know how strongly father is set against
everything of this sort.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you propose to let your father know
you’re in it?” asked Parmenter, half in sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Why, no; but he might find it out afterward.”</p>

<p>“I see no necessity for his doing so.”</p>

<p>“Well, I believe I’d about half as soon he
knew it, as to feel guilty every time he looked
at me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, do as you choose, of course. Perhaps
you’d better go out. But if you do, Henderson
will back out, and Brace, and the whole
thing will fizzle out before it’s fairly begun.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’d hate to spoil the plans of the
boys,” said Lee, hesitatingly, “and I wouldn’t
if it weren’t for—”</p>

<p>“I can’t see what objection there is,” interrupted
Parmenter, “to giving such a fellow as
Van Loan a little piece of humble-pie to eat.
His insufferable conduct has passed all bounds,
and there’s no other effective way of letting
him know it. We don’t propose to hurt him
physically, you understand, and the fellow can’t
be hurt mentally. But we can humiliate him,
and he deserves it. You can get out of it if
you want to; but you’ll miss the fun, and I
think after it’s over you’ll wish you’d gone.”</p>

<p>Lee was silent for a minute, turning the matter
over in his unstable mind.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, finally, “I don’t know;
maybe I’ll go after all. I’ll see.”</p>

<p>And he did go. Against his better judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and truer instinct he yielded to the logic of his
friend and the force of his own inclination, and
joined the party.</p>

<p>A few nights later Van Loan was waked at
midnight by a movement at his bedside. He
opened his eyes to see indistinct figures standing
about him. He knew in an instant what it
all meant; but before he could raise his head
from the pillow his hands were gripped and
held, and his mouth closed with a bandage so
that he could not call.</p>

<p>There was a moment of desperate but unavailing
struggling on his part; then, realizing
the uselessness of his attempt, he quietly submitted
to the will of his captors.</p>

<p>They took him from his bed, dressed him,
blindfolded him, bound his wrists together, and
led him down stairs and out-of-doors. It was
all done so quickly and noiselessly that the
slumbers of men in the adjoining rooms were
not disturbed.</p>

<p>The victim was hurried across the rear campus
and into the protecting darkness of the
college grove. Here torches were lighted, and
in single file the party marched through the
woods, across the corner of an open field, and
then into the thicker forest beyond.</p>

<p>At the end of half a mile they came to a
shallow cave in the face of a ledge of rocks. A
brawling brook ran by it, and overarching trees
helped shut it in. Here they halted, and made
preparations for what was to follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>After a few moments the victim’s eyes and
mouth were unbandaged. It was a grotesque
sight that he looked upon. The masks and
costumes of the hazers were both ludicrous
and hideous. Their huge mock weapons were
swung menacingly.</p>

<p>They arranged themselves in a semicircle
about the candidate. At their backs were the
mysterious shadows of the cave.</p>

<p>The Grand Inquisitor stepped forward, flourishing
a mighty broadsword—of wood. His
voice was deep and hollow.</p>

<p>“Before we proceed to the graver and more
intense portion of the initiation,” he said, “the
candidate is requested to reply to certain questions,
which, being satisfactorily answered, will
entitle him to pose for the first degree. The
first question is: Do you admire our personal
appearance? And the answer is: ‘Yes.’ The
candidate will please say ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Van Loan, without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Is it your fond and earnest desire to be initiated
into the grand and illustrious order of
Gamma Questers, without which honor you feel
that life is not worth living? The answer is
‘Yes.’ Say ‘Yes.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Van Loan, quietly.</p>

<p>“Do you desire any part of the initiation
ceremonies to be omitted, however painful, disagreeable,
or surprising they may prove to be?
The answer is, ‘No, I do not.’ Say so.”</p>

<p>Van Loan said so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you acknowledge yourself to be wholly
unfit and unworthy to enter into fraternal relations
with brethren so exalted as ourselves, and
do you humbly implore us to overlook your
thousand faults and follies, and to receive you
into fellowship? The answer is, ‘I do.’”</p>

<p>“‘I do,’” said Van Loan.</p>

<p>“Finally, <a href="#image01">will you always strive to uphold
the dignity</a> and further the aims <a href="#image01">of our most
noble order</a>, to endeavor, so much as in your
feeble intellect lies, to induce the president and
members of the faculty of Concord College to
become members hereof, and forgetting your unworthy,
dishonorable, and utterly idiotic past,
press on to the coveted goal that awaits all true
Gamma Questers? The answer is: ‘I will.’”</p>

<p>“‘I will,’” was the final response.</p>

<p>“Most Grand and Worthy Scribe, are the
candidate’s answers duly recorded?”</p>

<p>“They are,” came the reply in hollow tones
from a black-robed figure at the extremity of
the cave. He sat under a torchlight, his black
mask hideously splashed with red, an immense
volume spread open before him, and in his hand
a huge long-handled pen.</p>

<p>“Then advance and give the candidate sign
A, of rite number one.”</p>

<p>The person in the black robe arose, laid down
his pen, and advanced to within five feet of the
victim.</p>

<p>Van Loan stood quietly looking on, his face
pale with anger and excitement, and under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
eyes dark rings indicative of suppressed passion.
Yet, burning as he was with rage, he was still
calm enough to note with deep interest the
apparent inflexibility of the right arm and
shoulder of the person who approached him.</p>

<p>The Grand Scribe lifted his robe slightly,
preparatory to some mock ceremony of initiation;
but whatever his intention was, he never
carried it out. In that instant, Van Loan, who
had deftly slipped his hand from the bandage
that bound his wrists, reached out and tore the
mask completely from the face of the black-robed
hazer.</p>

<p>It was done in a second; and there, under the
glare of the torchlight, stood Parmenter, fully,
distinctly revealed.</p>

<p>“I thought as much,” was Van Loan’s quiet
comment; “now go on with the ceremony.”</p>

<p>Seeing that it was useless for him to contend
against so many, he had decided from the first
to obey implicitly the will of the hazers while
in their power, mentally reserving to himself
liberty to violate at pleasure any promise or
agreement he might make under such hard
conditions.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>BEFORE THE FACULTY.</small></h2>


<p>For an instant after Van Loan had uncovered
Parmenter no one stirred. The act had
been so sudden and unexpected that it startled
them all. Then a half-dozen men pounced
upon Van Loan, bound his wrists, and bandaged
his eyes again.</p>

<p>He was thoroughly helpless now, but the mischief
had been done. Parmenter, at least, was
in Van Loan’s power. The Freshman had seen
his face, and could prove that he was engaged
in an act for which he could be expelled from
the college.</p>

<p>The conspirators retired to deliberate. The
question what was to be done was a serious one.
Bessick, one of the rash ones, whispered, “Let’s
hang him up by the thumbs until he promises
that he will never reveal anything of what has
happened.”</p>

<p>“That would never do,” said Robinson.
“You can’t do anything but threaten. I think
he can be scared into keeping still.”</p>

<p>“Or bought off,” said another of the hazers.
“I tell you, bribery is the only thing for a man
with a character as mean as his.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>There were valid objections to all those
methods, and to every other plan that could be
conceived; but that the conspirators could not
go on with the hazing was plain. The life and
fun had dropped suddenly and disastrously out
of that, and the danger to at least one of them
was too great to be trifled with.</p>

<p>Parmenter again approached Van Loan, his
face still uncovered. The others followed to
listen. Parmenter’s face was pale, but wore not
the smallest look of fright, and he spoke quietly
but very firmly.</p>

<p>“You have found out who I am,” he said, “and
to a certain extent you have me in your power;
but there are some things that depend on the
use you make of the knowledge you have obtained
here to-night. If you can assure us that
you will keep it sacredly to yourself, I think you
can trust us, and each of us, to place no obstacle
in your way through college, nor harm you
in any way whatever. But I don’t need to hint
to you what may happen if you betray us.”</p>

<p>Parmenter paused, and Van Loan replied:</p>

<p>“I think I know what you mean. I propose
to keep the knowledge I have obtained here to-night
sacredly to myself.”</p>

<p>“Do you solemnly promise me, and each of
us, that you will never reveal my identity, nor
disclose to anybody at any time anything of
what has happened here to-night?”</p>

<p>“I make you that solemn promise.”</p>

<p>Van Loan’s voice certainly had in it the ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of sincerity. His captors could ask no more of
him than he had promised. The agreement was
definite, and both parties thoroughly understood
the situation.</p>

<p>Then they took Van Loan back to the college.
He was still bound, bandaged, and blindfolded.
They led him down the forest path, across the
fields, and through the college grove, and loosening
his hands, they left him in the middle of the
campus.</p>

<p>By the time he had freed himself, and could
look around, not one of the hazers was in sight;
and before he reached his bed the men who had
dragged him from it less than an hour before
were locked safely in their rooms.</p>

<p>The next day Parmenter and Van Loan met
each other face to face on the walk between the
colleges. There was a nod of recognition on
the part of each, but no word was spoken.
The same thing occurred the next day and the
next.</p>

<p>It leaked out after a time, as such things will,
that some sort of hazing had been done, and that
Van Loan was the victim of it; but who the
hazers were no one except those who had participated
in the affair appeared to know.</p>

<p>The origin of the rumor could not be traced
to Van Loan; there was nothing to indicate
that he was not keeping his promise.</p>

<p>As the days went by, and the situation remained
unchanged, Parmenter began to feel relieved.
The dread of discovery and consequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
punishment was rapidly disappearing from his
mind; but he was troubled about Lee.</p>

<p>Charley had sobered much since the night of
the hazing. It is true he worked harder; but
he went about his tasks with an anxious face,
and his laugh had lost much of the old-time,
merry ring.</p>

<p>He told Parmenter one day that it was a constant
trial to him to face his father, who had
heard with the utmost chagrin and sorrow that
the hazing had occurred, and who spoke bitterly
of it, but who evidently did not suspect that
his son had been one of the offenders.</p>

<p>“I feel guilty every time he looks at me,”
said Charley, “yet I know he doesn’t imagine
that I was in it. Why, he’d as soon think I’d
hang a man as haze him. That’s what’s hurting
me, you see. I can’t get over it. Fred, I’d give
up every college prize and honor I ever hope to
get, and do it gladly, if I could blot out my
part of that miserable night’s business.”</p>

<p>Parmenter threw back his head impatiently.
He felt, whether justly or not, that he was responsible
for Lee’s participation in the hazing,
and the young man’s passionate words of regret
cut him deeply.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said finally, “I don’t know that
there was any law obliging you to take part in
it. You joined us voluntarily, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. But after I’d helped start
the thing, and after what you said about my
backing out, you see I couldn’t very well—Fred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
forgive me! I didn’t know how that was going
to sound. I don’t mean to blame you, because
you’re not to blame, but—”</p>

<p>“Oh, go right on!” interrupted Parmenter,
coolly, his face a little pale and his lips drawn;
“go right on! I’m the only one who’s in danger,
anyway, and I might as well shoulder the whole
burden and have done with it. I’m perfectly
willing that all blame of any kind connected
with the affair shall be laid on me.”</p>

<p>Lee protested earnestly that he had no feeling
against Parmenter in the matter, and could
not have any. A truce was patched up between
them, but their relations afterward were not quite
the same.</p>

<p>Each felt a certain restraint while in the
other’s presence,—a restraint that might have
worn away in time, but which now had only
the effect of pushing them farther and farther
apart.</p>

<p>Parmenter applied himself with renewed energy
to the work of the term, and especially to
the task of perfecting himself in his Sophomore
oration.</p>

<p>He was passionately fond of oratory. Often,
sitting or walking alone, he imagined himself
on the prize stage in the midst of his triumph.</p>

<p>Before him in these visions stretched the long
aisles of the crowded church, the pews bright
with the evening costumes of the ladies, the air
heavy with the fragrance of many flowers. All
eyes were upon him. Every ear was attentive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to catch the sounding sentences that fell from
his lips.</p>

<p>The rustle and stir that passed through the
audience at some telling point in his oration
swept up pleasantly to his senses; the involuntary
burst of applause at some brilliant climax
rolled like a wave of delight into his soul; and
when, finally, he bowed and retired, there were
the marked and ribboned bouquets falling in
sweet showers on the stage to attest his popularity;
there was the long roll of applause rising
and dying and rising again, only to be drowned
at last in the music of the orchestra.</p>

<p>Oh, it was a splendid scene, a knightly test, a
thrilling triumph! To anticipate it, to see it all
in imagination as he did, left Parmenter in an
exalted state for hours.</p>

<p>But his days were far from being happy.
The anxious face of Charley Lee haunted him
wherever he went. The old love for his friend
was still strong enough in his heart to awaken
sincere pity.</p>

<p>He tried a dozen times to bridge over the awkward
restraint that separated them; and although
Charley was always anxious to assist him, somehow
the effort never succeeded. Though neither
young man knew it, success lay only in a radical
change of the conditions that surrounded
them. Since they had been partners in transgression,
they must needs be partners in expiation
before they could hope to count upon a complete
renewal of their old relations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Lee’s apparent mental uneasiness became the
source of deep annoyance to Parmenter at last.
Still feeling himself to be the cause of it, still
unable to banish it, it irritated him to such an
extent that he avoided his old friend’s society
lest he should, by open reproof or sharp rebuke,
cut the last tie of friendship.</p>

<p>So day after day the two drifted apart, and by
and by a new factor entered into the problem of
their estrangement.</p>

<p>It was whispered about that Professor Lee
had opposed Parmenter’s selection for the prize
stage. No one could tell how the information
got abroad, nor could any one at first state the
ground of the professor’s opposition. Later,
however, it was said to be because Parmenter had
his arm in a sling and could make no gestures.</p>

<p>But some one who pretended to know said
that Professor Lee did not so much object to
the fact of Parmenter’s disability as to the cause
of it.</p>

<p>The professor was reported to have declared
before the committee that Parmenter was the
leader in the moonlight rush; that it was a vulgar
exhibition of brute force and savagery, and
would lower the moral tone of the college for a
year; that hazing and rushing were the twin
relics of college barbarism; and that since the
first had been so effectually abolished, it was
high time for the committee to show their disapproval
of the other. He knew of no better
opportunity to do so than the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Parmenter could not learn where these reports
had originated. It was suggested that one of
the tutors had revealed the secrets of the committee-room
to an upper classman, and that the
matter had come out in that way. The story
had every appearance of verity, and caused Parmenter
no little anxiety and unpleasant thought.</p>

<p>Yet he said nothing to Charley Lee about it,
nor did Charley mention the subject to him.
Indeed, they saw very little of each other these
days.</p>

<p>Bessick came in one evening for a chat with
Parmenter. Bessick was one of the disappointed
candidates for the prize stage. The conversation
turned on Professor Lee’s position and
opposition.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” said Bessick, “that he
said just what has been reported.”</p>

<p>“But why should he select me as a target?”
asked Parmenter. “Every man of the six was
in that rush, Charley Lee included.”</p>

<p>“Well, I heard the matter discussed yesterday—now,
I’m not saying this to prejudice the
professor, you know, nor Charley, nor anybody;
and besides it may not be true. I hope it isn’t.
But I heard it talked that the thing was fixed
to get you out of the way.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know Lee is the only man in the
class who is able to compete with you, don’t
you? The prize lies between you and him—there’s
no doubt about that, is there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know. Suppose there isn’t; what
then?”</p>

<p>“Well, with you out of the way Charley’d
be sure to get it, wouldn’t he? And Sammy
Lee would crawl across the campus on his hands
and knees to have his boy take that honor,
wouldn’t he? You know that, don’t you?
And Charley—well, if you can’t see through
a door when it’s open, I’m sorry for you.”</p>

<p>Parmenter protested earnestly that he didn’t
think Sammy Lee would enter into such a plot,
and he was sure Charley wouldn’t; and Bessick,
declaring that he had no personal feeling in the
matter, and that he was simply repeating what
he had heard, took his leave.</p>

<p>But the seed he had dropped fell into soil
ready to receive it. The more Parmenter
thought about it and pondered over it, the more
he began to believe that Bessick’s theory had
some foundation.</p>

<p>One circumstance after another, developing
during the few days that followed Bessick’s visit,
tended to increase his distrust of Professor Lee
and his suspicion of Charley. Whispering
tongues were at work, adding one bit of gossip
after another to his stock of alleged information.</p>

<p>Finally it was rumored in his hearing that
Professor Lee was at work unearthing Parmenter’s
part in the hazing of Van Loan, and that
he would soon be called before the faculty on
that account.</p>

<p>Within ten minutes after this rumor reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Parmenter’s ears Mr. Delavan, one of the tutors,
knocked at his door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Parmenter,” he said courteously, “the
president desires to see you at his study.”</p>

<p>“At once?” asked Parmenter.</p>

<p>“At once.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll come right over.”</p>

<p>Tutor Delavan bowed and disappeared; and
Parmenter, feeling a sudden weakness in his
knees, resumed his chair for a few minutes before
answering the summons.</p>

<p>At last, he thought, the blow was about to
fall. Sammy Lee had procured his evidence!
Either Van Loan had turned traitor, or Charley
had—confessed, or some one of the remaining
twelve had broken his pledge. In whatever
way it had come about, he felt sure that it was the
result of a systematic attempt on Professor Lee’s
part to deprive him of his standing and disgrace
him; and his bitterness increased accordingly.</p>

<p>Parmenter’s breast was still heaving with
anger and apprehension as he entered the president’s
study, and faced the members of the faculty
who were gathered there.</p>

<p>President Mather, large, portly, dignified, sat
at the head of the table.</p>

<p>“I will tell you at once why we have sent
for you, Mr. Parmenter,” he said. “We are informed
that you participated in a hazing affair
on the night of the twelfth of April. We do
not, of course, intend to condemn you unheard.
What have you to say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Parmenter waited a moment before replying.</p>

<p>“Who is my accuser?” he asked.</p>

<p>“A member of the faculty has preferred the
charge,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“May I ask which member of the faculty?”</p>

<p>Professor Lee arose from his chair.</p>

<p>“I made the charge, Mr. Parmenter,” he said,
“upon information derived from a student at
this college.”</p>

<p>“May I ask what student?” again inquired
Parmenter.</p>

<p>“I am not at liberty to give you his name,”
was the reply.</p>

<p>The accused man turned again to the president.</p>

<p>“I demand the right to meet my accuser face
to face,” he said stoutly, determined to find out,
if possible, who had betrayed him.</p>

<p>“That we cannot grant you,” replied the
president, calmly, “until we know whether or
not you deny the charge.”</p>

<p>Again Parmenter hesitated. He had no
thought of denying the charge; but he thought he
was justified in endeavoring to learn how much
the faculty knew about the matter, and from
what source the information had been derived.
After a moment he said:</p>

<p>“Hazing is a very indefinite term. Of what
specifications does the charge against me consist?”</p>

<p>Some of the members of the faculty moved
uneasily in their chairs, impatient at what they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
considered pure evasion. But Professor Lee
rose again and said:</p>

<p>“I will answer the question. The charge is
that you, with certain other persons whose names
are at present unknown to us, entered the room
of Freshman Benjamin E. Van Loan on the
night of the twelfth of April last, masked and
disguised; that you took Van Loan forcibly
from his bed, bound, blindfolded and gagged him,
and compelled him to accompany you to a lonely
place in the woods, half a mile from the college,
where, with cruel persistence and fiendish ingenuity,
you maltreated his person and insulted
his manhood.”</p>

<p>Professor Lee’s voice had grown stronger as
he talked, his manner had become deeply earnest,
and his face showed marks of great excitement.
He paused for a moment, as if to grasp some
final thought. Then he went on.</p>

<p>“And I wish to say in your presence, sir, and
in the presence of the president and members
of the faculty, that in my judgment, no breach
of discipline that has occurred here in years will
so hurt us, and hinder us, and sap our moral
strength, as this revival of one of the most cruel,
brutal, and unmanly customs I have ever known.
I do not hesitate to say, sir, that if you are
guilty of the crime charged against you, there
is no punishment that we, as a faculty, have
the power to impose on you that will be too
severe.”</p>

<p>No one had ever before seen Professor Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
aroused to such an extent. As he resumed his
seat his face was glowing, his eyes were flashing,
his under lip was trembling with excitement
and indignation.</p>

<p>As for Parmenter, every word that came from
the professor’s lips fell upon him like a blow.
Never in his life before had any one dared to
use such language to him. It kindled in his
breast a perfect fire of rage and resentment.</p>

<p>Hot words came boiling to his lips. He had it
wildly in mind to fling into the face of this gray-haired
accuser the fact that his own son was no
less guilty than he who stood there under accusation,
and fully as deserving as he of those
bitter, cruel, and seemingly vindictive words.</p>

<p>“I regret,” he began slowly, “that you have
denounced me with such force and bitterness,
since your condemnation falls equally as heavily—”</p>

<p>Parmenter stopped suddenly. A spark of
manhood shot up from his breast at the supreme
moment, and closed his lips. Whatever the
provocation might be he would not stoop to such
meanness as that.</p>

<p>For one moment he stood, with white face
and clenched hands, stemming, with powerful
effort, the tide of speech that had threatened to
break disastrously from his lips. Then he
turned slowly to the president.</p>

<p>“I do not deny the charge,” he said.</p>

<p>“Have you anything to say in extenuation?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“We shall not keep you longer before us.
We thank you for your prompt attendance.
Good-morning, Mr. Parmenter.”</p>

<p>With much dignity President Mather bowed
the young man out.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>THE QUARREL OF FRIENDS.</small></h2>


<p>Parmenter, fresh from his extorted confession
of hazing, went back across the campus
with his mind in a tumult. Half a dozen students
spoke to him on the way, but he did not
answer them. He could see nothing but Professor
Lee’s white, strong face; he could hear
nothing but his terrible words of condemnation.</p>

<p>What right had this man to denounce him as
brutal and unmanly? Would he have dared
to do so if he had known how deeply his own
son was involved in the mischief? It was plain
that Charley had not told his father of the hazing.
Van Loan must then have broken faith.</p>

<p>But for the time all of Parmenter’s anger was
centered, not on Van Loan, who had betrayed
him, but on Professor Lee, who had denounced
him.</p>

<p>Every moment some new recollection of the
scene in President Mather’s study added fuel
to the flame of his resentment. His indignation
was so great that it had not yet even occurred
to him what punishment he should
receive for his offense, or whether he should
receive any.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>He went up the section stairs blinded with
passion, ready to strike out savagely at anything
and everything that pertained in any way to
Professor Lee.</p>

<p>When he entered his room he found Charley
Lee seated at his table. Certainly no meeting
could have been more opportune for trouble.</p>

<p>“I’ve been waiting for you,” Charley said
quietly. “I’ve just heard that absurd story
about father’s opposition to your appointment
to the prize stage.”</p>

<p>Parmenter went in and sat down. It was
apparent that Charley did not know what had
just happened, and Parmenter was not quite
ready to tell him. He replied with forced coolness:
“It seems to me that you’re a little late
in gathering news, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I suppose so,” answered Lee.
“I might have known of it days ago if I’d been
bright enough to take the hints I’ve had, and
catch the meaning of the remarks I’ve overheard.
But I didn’t dream of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, didn’t you? Well, what do you think
of it, now that you have heard about it?”</p>

<p>Parmenter was exasperatingly cool in manner
and tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think of it,” said
Charley, “it has taken me so by surprise. I
don’t know whether it has any foundation in
fact or not. At any rate, any suggestion that
father could have had any other object in view
than to sustain his well-known opposition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
physical violence of course you won’t believe.
Surely he has nothing against you personally.”</p>

<p>“No? Perhaps not; but can you explain to
me why it was, then, that he chose me as the
subject of his criticism and opposition? It occurs
to me, for instance, that you were about as
active in the rush as anyone, but I have not
heard that any objections were raised to your
going on the prize stage.”</p>

<p>Lee’s face turned red and then pale. Parmenter’s
speech cut deeply, but he kept his
temper. After a moment he said:</p>

<p>“I don’t think father intends to be unfair to
anyone, nor partial to anyone, especially to me.
And I repeat that he has nothing against you
personally. I’ve heard him speak of you in
the highest terms.”</p>

<p>“And I,” responded Parmenter, deliberately,
“have heard him speak of me in the lowest
terms.”</p>

<p>“Fred, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say. Within half an hour he
has charged me with being brutal and criminal
to the last degree.”</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake,” stammered
Lee, “some misunderstanding—certainly he—”</p>

<p>“None at all,” interrupted Parmenter, rising
from his chair and walking the floor savagely.
“He did it knowingly, deliberately, cruelly, in
the presence of the entire faculty.”</p>

<p>A light dawned suddenly upon Lee’s mind.
“Was it about the hazing?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course about the hazing. He had nothing
else to bully me for. It was his last chance
to put me down and clear the way for others.”</p>

<p>The fire that had been smoldering in Parmenter’s
breast was beginning to break out
uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Lee’s face turned pale again. He was making
an effort to hold himself in check.</p>

<p>“Don’t be unjust, Fred,” he said quietly.
“You know that opposition to hazing is father’s
hobby, if he has one, and you should make
allowance for what he says in his excitement.
But if you mean to insinuate that father is trying
to push me up at your expense, I want
you—”</p>

<p>“I mean to insinuate nothing,” interrupted
Parmenter, hotly. “I say plainly that there
seems to be a powerful effort in some quarters
to make me the scapegoat for the sins of the
whole class.”</p>

<p>“Fred, you are beside yourself.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be strange if I were. But what
I’m saying is the truth. Who else was criticised
and harassed for taking part in the rush? Tell
me of another man! Who else is summoned
before the faculty for hazing Van Loan, and
browbeaten, abused, and insulted? Are you,
for instance? Tell me! Had you less to do
with that affair than I? Yet you can walk
around in an atmosphere of innocence and
honor, unharmed and unsuspected, while I, poor
fool, must play the part of sacrificial lamb!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Parmenter’s face was white with passion.
He strode up and down the floor like a madman.</p>

<p>“Fred, be careful!” Lee’s voice had a ring
of danger in it now. “If Van Loan has betrayed
you, do not charge it up to me and mine.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was Van Loan, was it? I had my
doubts whether I was indebted to Van Loan or
you for that disclosure.”</p>

<p>This was cruel; besides, it was false, and Parmenter
knew it; but his rage was running away
with his conscience and his tongue.</p>

<p>“Take that back, Fred!” said Lee. “You
know it’s not true, and I won’t stand it!”</p>

<p>“I take nothing back!” shouted Parmenter,
angrily. “Do you hear me? Nothing!”</p>

<p>“Then you are a coward and an ingrate, and
I shall not stay to quarrel with you!”</p>

<p>“And I shall not attempt to detain you.
Good-morning, sir!”</p>

<p>The next moment Lee was gone, and the
friendship that had grown close and sweet between
these young men through two years of
college life had become a shattered and pitiful
wreck.</p>

<p>Charley went down the section stairs and
out on the campus, dazed and shocked. It was
the cruellest blow his life had ever known. He
would never have dreamed that Parmenter could
say such things to him, or he such things to
Parmenter.</p>

<p>He passed on across the campus with such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
burden of sorrow and anger on his mind that he
took no note where his steps were tending. He
looked up finally, and found himself in front of
President Mather’s door. By some connection
of ideas a new thought flashed into his mind.
He stopped to consider it.</p>

<p>“Why not?” he asked himself; “why not?
It is right; it is just; there is no reason why
one should suffer and not both. I will do it,
and do it now, while I have the strength, and
then he cannot taunt me with going free while
he suffers alone!”</p>

<p>Charley walked rapidly up the steps and
across the hall, and knocked at the president’s
door. He was bidden to enter. The members
of the faculty were still in the room, discussing
Parmenter’s case. They looked up at Lee in
curiosity and surprise. He advanced toward
the president and said:</p>

<p>“Doctor Mather, I desire to say that I took
part in the hazing of Freshman Van Loan in
April.”</p>

<p>The professors and tutors stared at him in
open-eyed astonishment.</p>

<p>“You did, Mr. Lee?” said the president
interrogatively.</p>

<p>“And whatever punishment,” continued Charley,
“anyone else receives for that offense, I
should receive the same.”</p>

<p>The president leaned forward in his chair.
“We thank you, Mr. Lee,” he said, “for coming
to us with this voluntary statement. Is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
anything else you wish to say about the matter—any
explanation?”</p>

<p>“No, nothing—except,” turning for a moment
toward his father, who sat dumb with
amazement and grief, “except that I am very
sorry, indeed, especially on father’s account.”</p>

<p>Then his lips trembled, his eyes filled with
tears; he turned to leave the room, and would
have stumbled and fallen had not Tutor Delavan
taken him kindly by the arm and led him
away.</p>

<p>It soon became known among the students
that Parmenter and Lee had been before the
faculty in connection with the Van Loan case.
The matter was discussed freely at the dinner
tables, on the campus, and in the sections; and
opinions were many and varied as to the form
and severity of the punishment that would be
meted out to the offenders.</p>

<p>That evening, as Parmenter sat alone in his
room, Tutor Delavan came in with a letter for
him. He delivered it with a few courteous
words, and retired as quietly as he had come.
Parmenter opened the letter and read it. It
ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><br />“<span class="smcap">Concord College</span>, May 5th.</p>

<p class="noi">“<span class="smcap">Mr. Alfred B. Parmenter</span>:</p>

<p>“<i>Dear Sir</i>,—The president and members of the
faculty have taken into consideration your acknowledged
connection with the hazing of Benjamin E. Van Loan
on the night of April 12th. We greatly deprecate so
serious a breach of college discipline. We desire to be
as lenient with you as possible; but it is our duty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
wish to banish this class of offenses from the college by
any and every means in our power.</p>

<p>“The judgment of the faculty is that your name be
stricken from the list of competitors for the Sophomore
prize of the present year; and that the competition for
honors and prizes in your Junior year be likewise closed
to you. It is accordingly so ordered, and of this order
you will please take notice.</p>

<p class="noic">“Yours with regret,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sydenham E. Mather</span>, <i>President</i>.</p>

<p>“<i>Attest</i>: <span class="smcap">R. E. Hagerman</span>, <i>Secretary</i>.”<br /></p>
</div>

<p class="p2">Parmenter laid the letter on his table, and
stared from his window across the fields, the
city, and the distant river to the far-off western
hills. They were simply a dark, uneven band
against a sky from which the deepening twilight
had brushed the last vestige of rose.</p>

<p>The punishment was severe enough in all conscience.
He could lay away the manuscript of
his oration now, or burn it up as he chose; he
would never need it. He would indeed need
nothing of the kind for two years.</p>

<p>Two years of punishment and disgrace for an
hour of silly revenge and doubtful fun! To
be cut off from the prize stage with the highest
honor almost within his grasp; it was hard, it
was terrible!</p>

<p>He had expected his mother and sister on at
Commencement, to share in his success. He
would have to write to them now that they need
not come. Worse than that, he would have to
tell them the reason why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>There were others, too, people in the city,
who knew of his hopes and ambitions in oratory.
He did not see how he could meet them now,
or speak to them on the subject.</p>

<p>Another man would take his place on the
stage. For some one else there would be the
golden opportunity, the exhilaration of oratory,
the admiration of the crowd, the ribboned bouquets,
the rolling applause, the splendid triumph.</p>

<p>Still he sat looking out upon the western sky.
One star was glowing in the clear expanse.
Below the horizon there was nothing but darkness,
pricked here and there by the lights of
far-off electric lamps.</p>

<p>At home there was a western porch where he
had often sat with his mother and sister to
watch just such an evening scene as this. His
lips began to quiver, and his eyes to fill with
tears. He turned back into the room, laid his
head down on his bed, and gave way, for the
first time in years, to a prolonged fit of weeping.</p>

<p>But Parmenter’s flood of tears had not the
effect to clear his mental sky.</p>

<p>When he awoke on the following morning his
heart was as hard and bitter toward Professor
Lee as before; this feeling, strangely enough,
still overshadowing his resentment against Van
Loan.</p>

<p>As for Charley, Parmenter felt that it was
all over between them now. The quarrel of the
day before had settled that; and while, in his
own mind, he knew that he had provoked it, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Charley had said some things in his anger which
he could not forget.</p>

<p>After the blow had fallen, Parmenter had not
cared to leave his room until night, nor to converse
with anybody; and he had not yet heard
of Lee’s confession.</p>

<p>Coming back up the hill from a late breakfast
that morning, and turning the corner of South
College to go into the chapel, he saw a crowd of
students at the bulletin-board reading and discussing
some notice posted thereon.</p>

<p>He did not need to be told what it was. Instead
of going to chapel to be gazed at and commented
on, he decided to pass directly to his
room. When he was nearly across the campus
he met Robinson hurrying over to chapel
exercises.</p>

<p>The bell was already tolling the final strokes,
but Robinson stopped to speak to him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, as if Parmenter already knew
all about it, “you and Charley are cut.”</p>

<p>“Charley,” exclaimed Parmenter in surprise.
“What’s he cut for?”</p>

<p>“Why, for the Van Loan business, you know—same
as you.”</p>

<p>“And who gave him away?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard? He went in before the
faculty yesterday, after they got through with
you, and accused himself—made a clean breast
of it, voluntarily. What do you think of that?”</p>

<p>Parmenter did not reply. He was too deeply
moved to speak. Robinson went hurriedly on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Bessick and Ogdenburg are put on in
your places. The rest of us are trembling in
our shoes, though I don’t know why we need
to; you and Charley won’t give us away, and
Van Loan can’t. Say, Fred! is there any doubt
but what Van Loan broke his promise? Everybody
thinks so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know, and I don’t care now,”
replied Parmenter, impatiently. Robinson
rattled on:</p>

<p>“I hear he denies it; but there was no other
way for it to get out, and he’s such an all-round
liar you can’t believe him. Say, Fred, when
you’re sure of it just let us know; and if that
Freshman don’t suffer for his perfidy, then—Oh,
excuse me! There’s the last bell.”</p>

<p>Robinson, who was an expert runner, shot
across the campus, and entered the chapel on the
heels of the last group of attendants.</p>

<p>Parmenter passed on wearily to his room.
And so Charley had confessed—and had been
cut! Parmenter wondered what motive had
prompted the confession. Was it weakness or
bravery?</p>

<p>Well, there was some satisfaction in knowing
that he himself was not the only one to suffer.
He did not know that he had much sympathy
to waste on Charley, after all. He was sure he
had none for Charley’s father.</p>

<p>He picked up a book and tried to study; but
he read the pages over and over again without
remembering a word that was printed on them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Deep in his breast a voice kept saying, “Poor
Charley! poor Charley!”</p>

<p>It aggravated him. He threw the book aside,
put on his hat, and started for the city. At the
college gate he came suddenly upon Lee, who
was walking up alone. His hands were deep
in his pockets, his gait was slow, his gaze was
on the ground.</p>

<p>When he looked up, Parmenter noticed that
his face was pale and haggard, and his eyes were
bloodshot.</p>

<p>Charley’s appearance indicated that he had
passed a sleepless night. He stopped, when he
saw Parmenter, and seemed about to speak; but
in a moment he changed his mind, for when
Parmenter stopped in his turn, ready to reply to
any friendly word, Lee passed on without a nod
or smile, or any kindly look.</p>

<p>After that, whenever the two young men met,
in the class-room, on the campus, or the street,
they had for each other nothing beyond the
merest look of indifference, the merest nod of
recognition.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<small>A COWARDLY REVENGE.</small></h2>


<p>It is hard to say whether Parmenter or Charley
Lee suffered more from their estrangement,
and impossible to declare which felt more
keenly the disgrace of his punishment.</p>

<p>Certainly Lee’s appearance indicated the
greater grief, but people said that was because
he was at home. There he had every day to
meet the sympathetic kindness of his mother,
which was worse than any reproach could be;
and there he had every day to see in his father’s
face the pained look which spoke more eloquently
than words.</p>

<p>Charley had not the firmness nor the mental
and moral strength of Parmenter. He was
kinder, more impulsive, more unselfish; but he
depended more on circumstances to keep him
at his best.</p>

<p>In the shadow of disgrace that had now
fallen on him he grew despondent, even despairing.
With the old companionship suddenly
lost he became unspeakably lonely. He
found it impossible to rise from beneath the
burdens that had fallen on him.</p>

<p>All the gentle home influence, all the friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
sympathy and assistance of those who had been
his companions in the better days, and who still
loved him none the less for the shadows that
rested on him—all these things were wholly
unavailing. He weakened, wavered, and broke.</p>

<p>He neglected his studies, avoided the class-room
on every pretext, lost his frank and cheery
manner, fell back mentally and morally with
startling rapidity. By and by it began to be
whispered about that he was becoming addicted
to intoxicating drinks.</p>

<p>One man had seen him drinking at a city
bar. Another had met him late at night, going
home with thick tongue and unsteady step.
No pains were spared to turn him back; but
father, mother, and friends labored, implored,
and suffered in vain.</p>

<p>There was but one person in the world who,
at this crisis, could have arrested young Lee’s
course and brought him back to safety. That
person was Parmenter—Parmenter as he had
been in the old days, strong in friendship, forceful
in will, undaunted by disaster.</p>

<p>He, by merely stretching out his hand, could
have turned Charley Lee back toward manhood.</p>

<p>But no one thought of that. The gulf between
the two young men had grown too wide.
Besides, Parmenter was demoralized as well as
Lee; he had not fallen in the same way, but
certainly he had fallen.</p>

<p>He, too, was neglectful of his studies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
remiss in his college duties. He avoided the
companionship of his fellows and sank, day by
day, into a state of listless self-sufficiency from
which all the efforts of his friends failed to
rouse him. Whispering tongues were again at
work, bringing to his ears tales of remarks, and
declarations made by Professor Lee and his
wife, charging Parmenter with being the cause
of their son’s downfall.</p>

<p>The young man bitterly resented these imputations,
and assumed at once that Professor Lee
had uttered them.</p>

<p>What right had they to charge him with
their son’s waywardness, when he had not even
spoken to the fellow for more than a month?
He could explain the story only on one hypothesis—Charley,
in his weakness, must have
complained of him. But poor Charley! he was
hardly responsible now for what he did.</p>

<p>Parmenter’s anger and resentment toward his
former friend had almost vanished, but the bitterness
in his heart toward Professor Lee
showed no abatement.</p>

<p>He had not yet given the word for Van Loan’s
punishment, although his old comrades had frequently
expressed a wish to “get even” with
that tale-bearer and breaker of promises. Not
that there was much doubt of Van Loan’s
perfidy, and not but that Parmenter thoroughly
despised him.</p>

<p>But Parmenter was too heartily sick of the
whole business to reopen old scores, and too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
listless and despondent to start new troubles.
Nevertheless, Van Loan was meeting with his
reward. It was well understood among the
students that his speedy release from the hands
of the hazers was due to his promise not to
betray Parmenter—a promise which, it was
believed, he had deliberately violated.</p>

<p>His class would have no more of his leadership.
His companions fell away from him. He
could no longer find attentive listeners to his
boastful tales.</p>

<p>He still kept at the head with his studies;
but being much alone, he grew downcast and
sullen. The humiliations to which he had
been subjected on the night of the hazing were
too deep for him ever to forgive or forget.</p>

<p>His hatred for Parmenter showed little abatement;
and when, by chance, it became known
to him that Lee was the one who had asked him
the insulting questions with their forced answers
on that miserable night, his feeling toward
Charley was scarcely less bitter.</p>

<p>Van Loan exulted in the punishment of the
two young men; he gloried in their downfall.
But his resentment was not satisfied by their
humiliation and disgrace. He waited for some
new opportunity to gratify his mean thirst for
revenge.</p>

<p>So far as Charley was concerned, that opportunity
came to Van Loan one day in a most
unexpected manner.</p>

<p>He went into a beer saloon in the city, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
place to which some of the more weak and
reckless of the students occasionally resorted.
Half a dozen men were in the room; and among
them, leaning against the bar, an object of entertainment
to them, was some poor fellow in an
advanced state of inebriety. It needed but the
second glance to tell Van Loan that the drunken
man was Charley Lee.</p>

<p>Lee discovered Van Loan at once.</p>

<p>“Hello, Vanly!” he cried. “Why, m’ dear
boy, I haven’t seen you since—since—say,
Billy,” turning to the saloon-keeper, who stood
behind the bar, “give this man a drink; anything
’e wants; he’s frien’ o’ mine.”</p>

<p>He had already staggered forward and embraced
Van Loan effusively. Some strange turn
of his drunken fancy had presented the man to
his disordered mind as his bosom friend.</p>

<p>For the moment Van Loan was at a loss
what to do or say. Then there shot suddenly
into his mind a scheme for revenge as daring as
it was dastardly.</p>

<p>“I will,” he said to himself, “lead this
drunken fellow through the streets of the city
and up College Hill to his home, in broad daylight,
a spectacle for all men!”</p>

<p>Van Loan turned the thought over in his
mind as if it were incomparably sweet. He
waited but a moment to perfect his plan. Then
he turned quietly to Lee.</p>

<p>“Come, Charley,” he said, “let’s go home and
sober up; they’ll be looking for you, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The saloon-keeper came out from behind the
bar and called Van Loan aside.</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of yours?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Van Loan.</p>

<p>“Well, hadn’t you better let him go up-stairs
and sleep this thing off?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the reply; “he wouldn’t get over
it till morning, and his father and mother
would be worried about him. No, I’ll take him
home.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll send for a close carriage for you.”</p>

<p>“No, you needn’t. He can walk well
enough.”</p>

<p>“My gracious! Look here! you don’t want
to show that young man up on the street like
that, do you?”</p>

<p>Van Loan turned on the man savagely.</p>

<p>“It’s none of your business what I want to
do!” he exclaimed. “Your part of the programme
was ended when you got him drunk.
Now you mind your affairs, and I’ll mind mine.
Come, Charley, let’s go.”</p>

<p>He went to Lee, took his arm, and led him
toward the door. The maudlin young fellow
waved his free hand broadly to the group at
the bar.</p>

<p>“Good-by, gen’l’men!” he shouted. “By,
Billy! Come an’ see us. Father d’lighted to
see you any time.”</p>

<p>The saloon-keeper shrugged his shoulders
suggestively, and made motions as if to wash
his hands, as once did Pilate of old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Van Loan struck the screen door open, and
the two young men passed out into the street.
It was no easy task to guide Lee’s wavering
footsteps. His weight rested heavily on Van
Loan’s arm; and at frequent intervals he
insisted on stopping and facing his companion,
in order to give greater emphasis to some expression
of his drunken fancy.</p>

<p>They met many people. Some of them, who
knew both young men, looked askance at them
as they approached, and then passed on with
knowing looks and scornful smiles.</p>

<p>At the corner of Centre and Concord Streets
they came upon Miss Darcy, a charming girl to
whom Lee had taken a strong fancy. She
stopped suddenly, staring at the pair in surprise.</p>

<p>“Is he ill, sir?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Worse than that,” replied Van Loan, smiling.
“You had better pass on, Miss Darcy;
his society is not agreeable to-day.”</p>

<p>She knew what the man meant, and turned
away in sorrow and humiliation.</p>

<p>Poor Lee, on seeing her, had attempted to
lift his hat, but had pushed it from his head
instead, and it had rolled into the street.</p>

<p>“S’cuse me, Miss Darcy,” he stammered;
“somew’at tired to-day. My frien’, Mr. Vanly,
he—I—” But Miss Darcy was already
out of hearing.</p>

<p>Van Loan braced his charge against a tree,
and went to recover the hat. Street-boys came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
up, and began to poke fun at the unfortunate
fellow, following him with jeers as he moved
on.</p>

<p>Half-way up Concord Street the pair met
President Mather, driving down with some
ladies of his family. Lee discovered them,
waved his hand grandly toward the carriage,
and called out:</p>

<p>“’Ello, Prexy! Beau’ful day, ladies! Comp’ments
of season to you all!”</p>

<p>The president reined in his team, observed
Charley an instant, and drove on.</p>

<p>They met a dozen people from College Hill,
acquaintances of both men, ladies and gentlemen,
who stopped for a moment to make sure
that it was a case of inebriety and not of illness,
and then passed on in pained surprise.</p>

<p>A party of students came down, curious and
sympathetic, making offers of help. Van Loan
declared that he wanted no assistance, and declined
their offers with scant courtesy. He
was having his revenge; it was deep and sweet
indeed; but he began to feel that he should be
glad when he got his burdensome charge inside
the door of his home.</p>

<p>At the college gate Parmenter met them. At
the first glance he did not recognize Lee.
When he looked at him again he was shocked
at the change in his appearance. Van Loan
would have passed on with his victim, but Parmenter
stopped them.</p>

<p>“Where did you find him?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“At Billy’s,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did you bring him from there?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Through the streets?”</p>

<p>“Through the streets.”</p>

<p>“On foot?”</p>

<p>“On foot.”</p>

<p>Parmenter’s blood was boiling with indignation.
In his righteous wrath he forgot that
Charley was not his friend as of old.</p>

<p>“Why did you do that devil’s deed?” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“To show the public what a beast the fellow
is,” replied Van Loan, fiercely; “and I’m taking
him to his father for the same reason. Get
out of my way and let us pass!”</p>

<p>Parmenter was at a white heat.</p>

<p>“Let go of him!” he cried. “Don’t lay a
finger on him! I’ll see him home. You’ve
about killed him already!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charley was leaning against a
gatepost, staring stupidly from one to the
other.</p>

<p>“Take the drunken fool, and welcome!”
cried Van Loan, turning away in a passion.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before
Parmenter shouted, “Put up your hands, you
brute. Defend yourself if you can. I’m going
to thrash you!”</p>

<p>“You—you!” screamed Van Loan, striking
a pugilistic attitude.</p>

<p>But he was no match for Parmenter, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
fist shot out next moment, struck Van Loan
squarely on the jaw, and sent him sprawling in
the dust of the road.</p>

<p>At that moment Tutor Delavan came up.
He knew intuitively what it all meant.</p>

<p>“Here, Parmenter,” he said, “let’s get Charley
into the house as quickly as possible. You
support him on that side, I will on this. If
ever a man was justified in knocking another
down, you were.”</p>

<p>They straightened the drunken man up, and
started with him along the college walk toward
his father’s residence, not stopping to answer
the questions nor satisfy the curiosity of those
whom they met.</p>

<p>Poor Lee had fallen suddenly into a sort of
stupor. His face grew pallid and his eyes
glassy. His chin dropped. He no longer tried
to speak, and his feet dragged so heavily that
he had almost to be carried.</p>

<p>For the first time since the quarrel, pity and
dread came into Parmenter’s breast. Never in
all his life had he looked upon a spectacle so
pitiable and so revolting.</p>

<p>The two men dragged their helpless burden
up the steps of Professor Lee’s residence, but
before they could ring the bell the professor
himself was at the door. The next moment they
were all in the hall, the street-door was closed,
the limp and insensible form of the young
man was laid carefully on the settee, and Delavan
had hurried off to find the college physician.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Lee pushed the hair back tenderly
from his boy’s eyes and forehead, then he
turned sharply to Parmenter.</p>

<p>“Did you lead him into this also?” he
asked, huskily.</p>

<p>The tone, the implication, roused the tiger
again in Parmenter’s breast.</p>

<p>“I did not,” was the swift reply. “I never
drank with him in my life, nor ever suggested
such a thing. I do not wonder, though, that
you lay this crowning disgrace of your son’s at
my door, since you have been pleased, without
cause, to charge to my account every fault and
folly of which he has been guilty for the last
six months.”</p>

<p>Professor Lee’s face was white with emotion.</p>

<p>“Look here, Parmenter!” he said, “this is
no time nor place for quarrels or explanations.
Let me say to you simply that I do not need
your presence here. You may go!”</p>

<p>Parmenter backed slowly down the hall,
awed and subdued by the man’s quiet anger.
He did not speak again. He cast one glance at
the poor, unconscious figure on the hall settee;
then he turned and left the house.</p>

<p>He went to his room and picked up a book,
but could not read. He went down to his supper,
but could not eat. He tossed about in his
bed all night, but he could not sleep.</p>

<p>He had unburdened his mind to Professor
Lee, indeed—a thing he had been longing to
do for weeks. But it brought him no relief.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
On the contrary, deeply angered as he was at
the professor, a flush of shame crept into his
face whenever he thought of the time and place
he had chosen for his protest.</p>

<p>His mind became gloomier and his thoughts
more desperate every day. He scarcely opened
a book to study from it. His brain was dull and
unsteady, and he could think of little else than
his own miserable condition and his unhappy
relations with the Lees.</p>

<p>He felt that Professor Lee had wronged him
beyond forbearance, beyond endurance, beyond
any hope of reconciliation.</p>

<p>As for Charley, his case was different. He
was weak, boyish, impulsive, influenced by his
father; but it might well be that time would
heal the differences between him and Charley.</p>

<p>This was Parmenter’s daily, his hourly
thought and hope; it was sweeter in his mind
than had ever been his visions of oratorical
success. For he had not been able, in all the
stormy days that had passed, to drive from his
heart the last spark of affection for the dearest
friend his young manhood had known.</p>

<p>And now, when that friend’s disgrace and
humiliation were deepest, the spark began to
take on new life, to kindle, to glow, to send
light and heat through his whole mental and
moral system.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was due in part to his memory
of that prostrate figure on the sofa in the hall.
It was a picture that he could not forget,—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
relaxed muscles, the pallid face, the disordered
hair, the glassy, half-closed eyes, the wreck and
ruin of young manhood stretched prostrate in
his father’s hall.</p>

<p>It was pitiable, it was dreadful—the sight
of death would have been less terrible.</p>

<p>Day and night this image was before Parmenter’s
eyes. Go where he would he could
not escape it. It followed him relentlessly. It
hung about him as persistently and ceaselessly
as his own shadow. It blotted out all thought
of anger or revenge toward Charley Lee; it
brought with it only patience, pity, a desire to
help, and a great longing to be reconciled.</p>

<p>Before he quite knew it himself, Parmenter
was sighing for the old companionship, looking
forward impatiently to the days when, with the
kindly help of each other, they would both be
themselves again; waiting with feverish anxiety
for an opportunity to get back on the old fair
footing with Charley Lee.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>ALMOST A TRAGEDY.</small></h2>


<p>Charley Lee had not been seen in public
since the day when his intoxication had been
so terribly exposed by Van Loan. Some of the
students said that he was ashamed to show himself;
others that his father was keeping him
prisoner. But after a little while the truth
came out, and all the college knew that he was
ill, and could not go out.</p>

<p>The reaction from his fit of inebriety had
been a severe shock to a system not especially
strong, and the disgrace which had fallen on
him preyed sharply on his mind. He suffered
a kind of nervous prostration, followed
by a low fever, and his strength gave way
rapidly.</p>

<p>Parmenter was stricken with grief and remorse.
His old friend’s illness swept away the
last vestige of his resentment. In all that had
passed between them, Parmenter came to recognize
no unfriendly acts but his own, no unkind
words save those which he himself had spoken.</p>

<p>He kept himself informed of Charley’s condition
through his friends; and at last, finding
that the sick man was not likely to be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
leave his room until after Commencement, he
sat down one day and wrote him this letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Friday Afternoon.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Charley</span>,—I feel that I have been a brute,
and I want to apologize. I also have some beggarly
excuses for my conduct which I would like to tell to you
personally, if I may call and see you. May I come,
and when?—Fraternally, <span class="smcap">Parmenter</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>He dispatched this message by the janitor’s
boy, and paced the floor of his room in a fever
of anxiety until the answer came. When the
boy returned with the letter, he snatched it
from his grasp, and tore open the envelope as
a starving man would break a crust of bread.
The message ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Fred</span>,—Never mind the excuses or the apology.
If you say it’s all right I’m satisfied. Only come
and see me and let’s get back on the old footing. Come
to-morrow morning, say about ten o’clock. I feel a
little more chipper mornings.</p>

<p>“You have my everlasting gratitude for making the
first advance. I don’t know whether I could have
brought myself to it or not. On second thought come
at nine o’clock—don’t wait till ten. Don’t fail me,
old boy.—<span class="smcap">Lee.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Parmenter sat down on the bed, and cried like
a child. Then he jumped up and wiped the
tears away, and laughed, and read the letter
again, and many times again. No pleasure that
his life had ever before known had thrilled
him as did these simple, tremulously written
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>He went to the window, and looked out upon
the sweet June landscape. What a glorious
day it was! He seized his hat and left the
room singing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“And what is so rare as a day in June?<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Then, if ever, come perfect days;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And over it softly her warm ear lays.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He went down the stairs two steps at a time.
Some students in the lower hall, hearing his
cheery voice and seeing his radiant face, so
wondered at the transformation that they turned
and followed him.</p>

<p>Out on the campus was a crowd of Sophomores
getting up a game of foot-ball. Parmenter
went over, and begged to be allowed to
play with them, and they gladly gave him his
old place in the team.</p>

<p>And how he did play! What tremendous
runs he made!—though he had moped so long
that he was not in his usual condition. How
he shouted and laughed at each brilliant point
in the game, and shook hands all round when
his team came out victorious!</p>

<p>Every one wondered and rejoiced at his
changed manner, and said that for some unexplainable
reason “Richard was himself again.”</p>

<p>That evening Parmenter sat with a group of
students on the terrace, and sang college songs
for an hour in the good old fashion; and when
he went to bed he slept with such refreshing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sweetness as he had not known before for many
weeks.</p>

<p>The next morning he arose early. It was
Saturday, and there were no recitations nor examinations.
The work of the term was finished,
and the next week was to be given up to the
pleasures of Commencement. Parmenter started
out for a walk before breakfast.</p>

<p>The morning was exceptionally beautiful,
even for June. He crossed the campus and
struck into the woods, drinking in the dewy
perfumes as he went, feasting his eyes on sylvan
sights, listening, with rapt ears, to the
music of the singing birds. He thought he had
never in his life before seen a morning so
thoroughly charming as this.</p>

<p>At one time he found himself in the path
leading to the ledge where they had taken Van
Loan that miserable night in April. He turned
aside at once, and struck off in another direction.
He did not care to revisit the scene of
that night’s folly. The shadow of this incident
was the only one that fell upon his spirits during
all that long and beautiful morning walk.</p>

<p>When he returned to the college grounds he
started across the campus on his way to breakfast,
refreshed, vigorous, hopeful, with the sunshine
of a brighter day than he had known for
months already flooding his heart.</p>

<p>In front of the chapel a group of young men
stood in earnest conversation; at the corner of
South College a half-dozen more were talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to each other in subdued voices. The expressions
on their faces indicated that something
had gone wrong.</p>

<p>Parmenter did not stop to inquire what it
was. Somehow he did not dare to. He pushed
on, with a sudden sinking of heart, until he came
in front of Professor Lee’s residence.</p>

<p>He stopped and glanced up at the house uneasily.
People seemed to be moving about hurriedly
in the upper rooms. The hall door
opened as he stood there; and Mr. Delavan, the
tutor, came out and down the steps. Parmenter
approached him and asked hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“Is Charley about the same as yesterday?”</p>

<p>The tutor looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard,” he replied, “of his
changed condition?”</p>

<p>“No,” responded Parmenter, huskily, backing
up against a tree for support. “How
changed—worse?”</p>

<p>“Yes, much worse. An intense fever, accompanied
by delirium, set in last evening and
rapidly exhausted him. He lies now in a state
of coma, with symptoms of heart failure.”</p>

<p>“Will—will he die?”</p>

<p>Parmenter’s lips were white, his knees were
trembling, his voice was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>“They have little hope of saving his life.
The end may come at any moment. Here, take
my arm. The news has unnerved you. I am
going your way; I will walk with you.”</p>

<p>Parmenter went to his room, but he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
not stay there. In ten minutes he was out on
the campus asking for the latest news from
Charley. He sat on the terrace wall in a place
where he could watch the Lee house. As often
as the door opened he caught his breath in the
dread that some one would bring out news of
Charley’s death.</p>

<p>But Charley still lived. The spark of life
in his body paled and glowed alternately, and
as the day wore on, hope revived.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Parmenter caught
sight of Doctor Park, hurrying along in front
of South College. He ran and overtook him.</p>

<p>“What about Charley?” he asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>“My dear man,” said the doctor, kindly,
“we can’t tell. He is alive; we are making
every effort to keep him alive. That is all I
can say.”</p>

<p>The night came on, but Parmenter did not
sleep. Many times in the darkness he crept
down the section stairs, across the campus, and
over to the house where Charley lay. There
were lights in the windows. He could see
people moving about in the rooms, and twice
some one came out of whom he could make
inquiries.</p>

<p>Just before dawn he stood in the shadow of
the great elm by the side of Professor Lee’s
gate, waiting to see or hear some one or something
from his friend.</p>

<p>The hall door opened, and the professor himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
came out. With his hands behind him,
and his face turned toward the stars, he came
down to the gate, and out on the walk, passing
under the gas-lamp within five feet of Parmenter,
and continuing along the terrace to the college
gate. There he turned, came back the
same way, and reëntered his house.</p>

<p>That face, as Parmenter saw it under the
lamplight, coming and going, struck him to the
heart. Never before in his life had he seen
such woe and hope expressed in a single countenance.
Never before had he seen the intense
desire of a man’s heart strained through his face
like this.</p>

<p>Was it possible that this was the man whom
he had charged with unjust motives, with
double dealing, with conduct entirely at variance
with the whole tenor of his good and gracious
life? And what foundation was there for
the charge?</p>

<p>As he stood there, Parmenter went over in
swift review the reasons for his hatred of Professor
Lee. He stripped them of their fallacies,
of their sophistries, of their baseless judgments,
till they stood naked and shrinking before him;
and then for the first time he realized how
utterly unworthy he had been to criticise the
motives or denounce the conduct of such a man.</p>

<p>He went back to his room under the dawn-flushed
sky, more wise and more humble than
he had ever been before.</p>

<p>All through the quiet Sunday Charley lay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
gaining a little hour by hour, and when night
came again they said that now he had a fair
chance to live.</p>

<p>Early on Monday morning the word went
round that there would be a college meeting in
the North College Hall, and it was whispered
that Van Loan’s case would be taken up and
disposed of. The feeling against him on account
of his heartless exposure of Lee had become
intensified with Charley’s critical illness;
and now that the strain of suspense was somewhat
relieved, it sought to find vent.</p>

<p>The meeting was large beyond precedent.
Davis, the honor man of the Senior class, was
made chairman; and White, a Freshman, arose
and offered the following resolutions:</p>

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>: Benjamin E. Van Loan, a member
of the Freshman class, was, on the afternoon of
the seventeenth day of the present month, guilty
of an offense unbecoming a student of Concord
College, unmanly and inhuman in the extreme,
and</p>

<p>“<i>Whereas</i>: For his said offense and certain
abusive language connected therewith Sophomore
Alfred B. Parmenter promptly knocked
him down, therefore be it</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>: That the hearty thanks of the
students at Concord College are due to the said
Parmenter for his just and timely blow, and be
it further</p>

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>: That while the students do not
desire to usurp the powers of the faculty, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wish to express it as their undivided opinion
that the interests of all persons will be better
served if the said Benjamin E. Van Loan shall
sever his connection with Concord College at
the end of the present college year.”</p>

<p>The resolutions were carried with a rush.
Not a dissenting voice was heard. A committee
of three was appointed to present them to
Van Loan.</p>

<p>When, an hour later, this committee went to
Van Loan’s room, he was not there. The room
was in disorder, as if he had made ready for a
hasty flight. The committee on presentation
of resolutions has never yet been able to report
its duty fulfilled, for the reason that Van Loan
has never since been seen at Concord College.</p>

<p>During the day it was said that, with the
greatest care and the most complete rest and
quiet, Charley might recover. Thereupon
Charley’s classmates formed themselves into
squads, and took turns in patrolling the grounds
about the Lee house.</p>

<p>They allowed no one to walk on the stone
pavements in that vicinity. They kept away
all noise and intrusion. They themselves went
about their duties on tiptoe and spoke in whispers.
Nothing was left undone by any one on
the hill to help forward the chances of Charley’s
recovery. The Seniors gave up their class ball
on his account, and the Juniors their “cremation.”</p>

<p>No bells were rung, no terrace songs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sung; the quiet of a peaceful Sunday reigned
for days between South College and the gate.</p>

<p>On Commencement Day the announcement
was made from the stage that the danger line
in Charley’s case had been passed, and only the
unexpected would now prevent his recovery.</p>

<p>A great cheer went up from the vast audience;
for Lee, in spite of his last few months of
ill behavior, was still the best-loved fellow on
the hill.</p>

<p>This was on Wednesday. On Thursday
Parmenter started for his home, three hundred
miles away. He had seen neither Charley
nor Professor Lee; it was not possible to
do so. But he was content now to bide his
time for explanation, for confession, for reconciliation.</p>

<p>Mr. Delavan had told him on the day of his
departure of some things that gave him a
clearer insight into Van Loan’s perfidy, and into
Professor Lee’s simple honesty of character;
and in the days of sober thought that followed
he felt more and more how unworthy had been
his self-made charges and suspicions, how unjustifiable
and unmanly had been his treatment
of Professor Lee.</p>

<p>In August a rumor reached Parmenter that
the Lees were going to Europe for a long vacation.
Both Charley’s health and his father’s
demanded the change, and Mrs. Lee was to go
with them. Parmenter was aroused by the
news into sudden activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>He had looked forward to the opening of the
term in September as the time when he should
go to the man whom he had wronged, arraign
himself, plead guilty, and ask to be forgiven.
He could not postpone that duty for a year,
perhaps for two years longer; he felt that he
could not bear the burden of his shame for all
that time, nor rest in the uncertainty of only a
possible reconciliation.</p>

<p>He <em>must</em> see Professor Lee and Charley before
they sailed.</p>

<p>He threw a few things into a satchel, and
took the next train for the East. He traveled
a night and a day, and the next afternoon he
found himself hurrying up Concord Street to
College Hill.</p>

<p>Certainly there was no time to lose.</p>

<p>“All gone away to New York this morning,”
said the servant at Professor Lee’s house, when
Parmenter rang the bell. “They’ve started
for Europe!”</p>

<p>Parmenter was almost speechless with dismay;
but he had enough presence of mind to
ascertain that they were not to sail until the
next morning, and that they were to go on the
steamship <i>City of Paris</i>.</p>

<p>Away he went to the railroad station, just
in time to swing himself upon the train for
New York. At Albany he went into a sleeping-car,
but did not have his berth made up. He
knew he could not sleep. His whole being had
turned toward the accomplishment of one object—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
find the two men he had so deeply
wronged, and beg their forgiveness.</p>

<p>At five o’clock in the morning the train rolled
into the Grand Central Station in New York
City. Parmenter rushed out hotly and hailed
a cab.</p>

<p>“Drive me to the Inman pier!” he called to
the cabman. “Don’t waste a second. There’s
money in it for you.”</p>

<p>The vehicle rattled swiftly over rough places
and smooth. Parmenter fretted nervously within.</p>

<p>At last the cab pulled up at the entrance to
a pier. Parmenter leaped out, handed the cabman
a sum of money that surprised and delighted
him, and plunged at once into the shadows of
the long buildings. He hurried down, between
rows of bales and boxes, toward the landing-place.</p>

<p>Some people were coming leisurely up; a
family group stood not far away, the persons in
it weeping quietly; the edge of the pier was
lined with men and women, and at the farther
corner of it were many who were waving handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>An officer with a gold band around his cap
stood looking out upon the water.</p>

<p>“Where is the <i>City of Paris</i>?” inquired
Parmenter of him.</p>

<p>“There she is,” replied the officer, pointing
to a majestic steamer in midstream, gay with
flying colors, and heading down the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has she gone?” gasped Parmenter.</p>

<p>“It looks as if she had,” replied the officer,
smiling.</p>

<p>In sudden weakness and despair Parmenter
staggered to an empty truck, sat down on it,
and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />
<small>THE WELCOME HOME.</small></h2>


<p>Parmenter went back from New York to
his home, and spent a night writing a letter to
Professor Lee, which was to reach him at Paris.
When it was finished the young man read it
over, and threw it from him in disgust. It
sounded tame, formal, insincere. He felt that
such a letter would fail of its mission.</p>

<p>He tore it up and wrote another, but with no
better success. He tried to write to Charley,
but his heart and courage gave out in doing
that. He knew that such desperate illnesses as
Charley’s sometimes washed the soul clear and
the mind free of everything that had stained
and clogged it. Charley might no longer feel
any need for his friendship.</p>

<p>Parmenter perceived at last that such an
offense as his could be explained, and apologized
for only in person. Written lines were
wholly inadequate. It needed the voice, the
eyes, the spirit breathing through the words, to
make them effective. He knew now that his
confession and his plea must await Professor
Lee’s return.</p>

<p>Now and then he heard indirectly from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
travelers. They had been in Berlin, in Vienna,
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Copenhagen. The
next winter they wrote from Florence, and
afterward they journeyed through the Holy
Land. Charley was gaining every day in
health and strength; still they were not ready
to return.</p>

<p>Parmenter waited with all patience and in
all hope. He devoted himself to his studies;
he worked at his college tasks with the strength
and earnestness of an enthusiast. He regained
his former position in the class. His old,
cordial manner came back to him. He was
once more a favorite and leader among his
fellow-students.</p>

<p>The experiences, the follies, the remorse, the
suffering, of that second college year had turned
the channel of his life and thought, and he
stood on the threshold of a broad, earnest, and
sincere manhood.</p>

<p>Two years went by, and Commencement was
at hand again. Parmenter’s class was to graduate,
and Parmenter himself was to have the
valedictory. All deemed it certain that he
would carry off the lion’s share of the honors
of Commencement Day.</p>

<p>There was no better speaker in the class
than he, and the first prize in oratory was sure
to fall to him. There was no quicker and
more logical thinker in debate. The big Dobell
prize was conceded to him in advance. So far
as the essays were concerned, no one hoped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
surpass him. In class standing it had long
been known that he was first.</p>

<p>Commencement Day was sure to be a great
day, and a succession of triumphs, for Parmenter.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing that will give any
of the rest of us a chance,” said Robinson to
him, banteringly; “and that is for you to get
into a cane rush and break your collar-bone
again; and if you could manage also to fracture
two or three ribs while you’re about it, you
would confer a lasting debt of gratitude on
your disconsolate classmates.”</p>

<p>There was another thing, too, that was going
to happen. “Sammy Lee” was coming home.
He and his wife and Charley had already set
sail for America. They would reach New York
on Tuesday of Commencement week, and be at
home on Wednesday morning for the Commencement
exercises.</p>

<p>A private letter from Professor Lee had communicated
the news, joyful to all his friends at
the college, that Charley would return fully
restored to health and strength, wholly free
from his old weaknesses, ready to take up his
work where he had left it off, and earnest in
his desire to reach up to the measure of sterling
manhood.</p>

<p>A small party went down to New York from
the college on Monday night to meet the Lees
when they should land, and escort them home.
Parmenter was among the number. When his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
friend Robinson heard that he was going, he
said to him with great earnestness:</p>

<p>“Why, Fred, you’re crazy! You can’t get
back here till Tuesday at midnight, at the very
best; and how can you expect to go on the
stage Wednesday morning all broken up with
the journey, and be any credit to yourself or
your friends? For your own sake, and the
sake of your class, you ought not to do it.
With all due deference to Sammy Lee, I repeat
that you’re crazy.”</p>

<p>Robinson paced the floor in a high state of
indignation, forgetting, in his unselfish zeal for
his friend’s success, that he was himself a competitor
for the same honors.</p>

<p>Parmenter smiled a little, and said quietly,
“Don’t fret, Rob. I want to see the professor
and Charley when they land; but I shall be
back here all right on Wednesday morning, and
all ready.”</p>

<p>So Parmenter went to New York. Some of
Professor Lee’s enthusiastic admirers among
the alumni there had chartered an excursion
steamer to go down the bay, meet the incoming
ocean vessel, take the professor and his family
off at quarantine, and give them such a welcome
home as they would not soon forget.</p>

<p>Invitations were sent to all the old Concord
boys and their families to accompany the party,
and quick messages were to notify them to
hasten to the pier of the excursion boat as soon
as the incoming vessel should be sighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>But Tuesday morning went by and no call
came. Noon passed, and the steamer had not
yet been heard from. The party of undergraduates
and alumni that had gathered at the
office on the pier dwindled slowly as the afternoon
slipped by, until at last only Parmenter
and Delavan were left. Delavan had stepped
from the place of tutor up to a professor’s chair;
he filled it most worthily.</p>

<p>He pulled out his watch, glanced at it, and
turned to Parmenter in surprise.</p>

<p>“Why, man!” he exclaimed. “What are
you thinking of? You have barely time to get
to the Grand Central Station before the last
train goes out. Come, I’ll go to the station
with you, but I won’t go up to-night. I’m not
needed at the college, and I’ll wait for Professor
Lee.”</p>

<p>He had started to his feet and was moving
toward the door. Parmenter sat still.</p>

<p>“I’m not going up to-night, either,” he said,
quietly.</p>

<p>Delavan turned back in amazement.</p>

<p>“But my dear man,” he exclaimed, “to-morrow
morning is Commencement! You’re on
the Commencement stage!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I shall not be there.”</p>

<p>The young professor came back into the
room and sat down.</p>

<p>“Parmenter,” he said, “what does this mean?
Surely you are not going to let the honors of
Commencement Day slip by you in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
meet Professor Lee and Charley as they land?
I know something of what has happened between
you, and what you hope for in the way
of reconciliation, and let me assure you that
this action is certainly uncalled for. Pardon
me, my dear boy, but it’s foolish!”</p>

<p>Then Parmenter awoke. “Look here, professor!”
he said warmly. “I have been waiting
for this meeting for two years. I have
thought of it night and day. The hope that it
may not be wholly fruitless has kept me from
disgrace and despair. Do you suppose that a
petty prize or the gratification of a selfish ambition
would be enough to send me running like
a coward from it now?”</p>

<p>“Why, Parmenter, I didn’t know that you—I—”</p>

<p>“I wronged Professor Lee!” interrupted
Parmenter, hotly. “I wronged him terribly.
I contributed my share, and it wasn’t a small
one, to his son’s disgrace; and I’ve never said
to him one word of contrition, of repentance, or
regret. It’s too late to make him any adequate
reparation now; but I can be here to meet him
and Charley when they land, to acknowledge
my fault to him, to tell him of my grief and
humility, and ask him to try me again, and
prove me that I am wiser and juster than I
was. Now tell me, professor, isn’t that the
least that I can do and have any semblance of
a man about me?”</p>

<p>Parmenter had risen in his excitement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stood with flashing eyes, flushed face, and heaving
breast. Delavan went up to him and took
both his hands.</p>

<p>“I understand you, my dear fellow,” he
said, quietly. “You are right. Come, let’s
telegraph up to them that we’ll not be there.
Then we’ll go back up town.”</p>

<p>Commencement Day dawned bright and beautiful.
It always did. No one had ever known
a rainy Commencement Day at Old Concord;
and the day was just as beautiful on New York
Bay as it was in the college city.</p>

<p>The ocean vessel had been sighted late in
the morning; and the excursion steamer, with
more than a hundred enthusiastic men and
women on board, was pulling rapidly down to
meet her.</p>

<p>The little boat was gay with bunting. Flags
and banners floated from every pole and post.
A great streamer at the bow bore the name of
“Concord,” and another at the stern displayed
the college cry.</p>

<p>There was a brass band on the boat, and a
brass cannon; and lest these should not meet
the anticipated demand for noise, every person
on board was supplied with a college fish-horn.
But the party failed to reach quarantine in
time. They had hardly got below Governor’s
Island when the black hull of the great vessel
loomed up on the smoky horizon, beating up
the bay toward them. Ten minutes later the
two steamers, big and little, were directly opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
though at some distance from each other.
Then the reception began.</p>

<p>It was peculiarly a college boys’ reception.
Human throats vied with brass instruments,
with booming cannon, and the blare of horns in
proclaiming welcome to the travelers.</p>

<p>When the people on the big steamer realized
that the demonstration was for some of their
number, they crowded to the side of the vessel,
and waved handkerchiefs and hats.</p>

<p>After a few minutes one of the upper guard
rails was cleared, for a little space, of all the
human figures save one. That one no one who
knew him could fail to distinguish as “Sammy
Lee.” He stood, with bared head, waving his
hat in one hand and his handkerchief in the
other, and apparently shouting some response
at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Then he called his wife and son to his side;
and from that point up the bay and all the way
to the steamer’s pier the three stood together
responding as best they could to the cries and
cheers, the music and the noise, the waving
hats and handkerchiefs that continuously greeted
them.</p>

<p>At last the big steamer reached her pier and
swung slowly in; and the smaller boat made
fast to the wharf that the excursionists might disembark
and greet the travelers as they landed.</p>

<p>Through all this demonstration Parmenter
stood quietly in the background, joining occasionally
in the cheering, brushing the tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
from his eyes now and then, as he noted the
sincerity and enthusiasm of the greeting.</p>

<p>He went out on the pier with the others, but
remained in the rear. Now that his great
opportunity had arrived, he hardly knew how
to avail himself of it. His heart beat thunderously
against his breast.</p>

<p>Far up the pier he saw Professor Lee and
his wife and son come down the bridge. Then
they were swallowed up in the circling crowd
that pressed forward to greet them.</p>

<p>Parmenter’s heart failed him then; his courage
gave way, and he turned aside and stood
by a wharf-post, with his face toward the water,
that people passing by might not see his tears.</p>

<p>After a little some one touched him on the
shoulder, and he turned to see who it was.</p>

<p>“Charley!”</p>

<p>“Fred!”</p>

<p>For one second the two men looked into each
other’s eyes; then their hands met in a heart-thrilling
clasp, then their arms were laid lovingly
across each other’s shoulders.</p>

<p>They were again in complete accord. No
words were necessary to assure them of that.
If they had been necessary Parmenter could not
have spoken them. The lump in his throat had
effectually choked his utterance. After a
minute he managed to stammer out:</p>

<p>“Charley—your father—I wronged him!
I want to explain—confess—and get forgiveness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Lee swung quickly around, and pierced to
the center of the party that was coming slowly
down the pier. He whispered something into
his father’s ear, drew him quietly from the
throng, crossed over with him to where Parmenter
stood, and then left them alone together.</p>

<p>The crowd moved on, laughing and chatting,
casting backward glances at the two who remained
behind, wondering a little but knowing
scarcely anything of the drama that was being
reenacted with lightning-like rapidity in those
two hearts.</p>

<p>Those who looked at the two men a minute
later from the deck saw that something unusual
was going on. They saw Parmenter standing,
hat in hand, looking straight into the professor’s
eyes, and talking with terrible earnestness.</p>

<p>They saw, too, that though he did not move
a muscle, his face was white and his hands
were tightly clenched.</p>

<p>The first time that Professor Lee interrupted
him he reached out and touched the young
man’s shoulder gently. The next time he
grasped both of Parmenter’s hands in his and
held them fast; and the third time, after a flow
of impassioned words that came hot from the
penitent’s heart to his mouth, the old man drew
the bared young head down toward him and
pressed it tenderly with his lips. That was all.</p>

<p>After that they came back, arm in arm, to
the boat. Tears were in Parmenter’s eyes, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his face was radiant with the sunshine of reconciliation.</p>

<p>When every one was on board again the
excursion steamer left the pier for a run down
the bay and a trip up the North and East
Rivers. A luncheon was served; and after that
the party gathered in the cabin, and Professor
Lee responded to a brief address of welcome.</p>

<p>He had never spoken better in his life—never
more earnestly, never more joyously.
His magnificent reception had warmed his heart,
and filled it to overflowing with gratitude and
enthusiasm. He told briefly of his travels, and
of the pleasure he found in his return home.</p>

<p>“This morning,” he said, “with my wife and
son, I was looking over our baggage preparatory
to meeting the customs officers. Happening
to look out on the bay I saw your boat
with its flags and bunting, its college mottoes,
and its college colors, and its decks dark with
people. I could not believe my eyes. I dared
not speak of it to my wife and son.</p>

<p>“I stole away and went on deck to assure
myself. Then I heard a great cry of ‘Sammy
Lee!’ and I said to myself, ‘Sammy, it’s you
they’re after—sure.’</p>

<p>“So I ran down, and called to Mrs. Lee and
Charley. ‘Come,’ I said, ‘come on deck quick!
Let the baggage go! let the custom-house
officials go! let everything go! The <em>boys</em> are
here to welcome us home.’</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, there were men on that vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
who are worth millions. There were high dignitaries
of church and state on board. Yet I,
poor as a church-mouse, not known beyond the
circle of my own pupils,—I, for my own sake,
for the sake of the dear ones who are with me,
for the sake of the grand old college that I
have the honor to represent, have commanded
such a reception to-day as those men with their
combined wealth, power, and influence couldn’t
buy, force, or borrow for a single moment.</p>

<p>“I feel it to the bottom of my heart. I shall
never forget it. I shall live this scene over in
my mind every day so long as I remain on
earth.”</p>

<p>There was a storm of applause. When it
had subsided the professor continued:</p>

<p>“I went away from you two years ago, tired,
hurt, and miserable; but I come back to you
filled with new life. If there were any wounds
still open when I entered New York Bay this
morning your sovereign remedy of welcome has
completely healed them; if there was one hard
or bitter feeling still lingering in my breast
when I stepped upon that pier an hour ago, the
splendid courage, the manly confession, the
magnificent self-sacrifice, of one among you has
swept it from its hiding-place forever.”</p>

<p>Again the storm of cheers and applause burst
forth. No one understood perfectly what it
was all about, but every one felt that the
allusion was to Parmenter.</p>

<p>“So I am come to you again,” the speaker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
continued, “with nothing but love and gratitude
in my heart for all of you—with nothing
but affection for the dear old college and all
who are in it or of it, with the peace and quiet
of serene old age stealing softly over me; with
the only grief I have ever known, during all my
life among you, lost and buried in the beautiful
memories of the past. I thank you—thank
you a thousand times; and God bless you
always!”</p>

<p>His voice broke at last, and he sank into his
seat and brushed away his tears. But all his
boys knew that they were tears of joy and not
of sorrow, and the flow of spirits and good-fellowship
burst forth anew.</p>

<p>Commencement Day at Concord went gloriously
by. In the absence of Parmenter, Robinson
was the most conspicuous member of the
graduating class, and had the largest share of
honors.</p>

<p>At midnight Professor Lee and his party
reached the city, and found a rousing welcome
awaiting them at the train. In some unaccountable
way Parmenter’s story had traveled home
ahead of him, and he had to share with the
professor and his family the honors of the night.</p>

<p>Later a great crowd of students, with Parmenter
and Charley Lee arm in arm in the
midst of them, marched up the hill and through
the college gate, singing as no one had ever
heard them sing before.</p>

<p>The party halted in front of Professor Lee’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
residence and sang: “Here’s to Sammy Lee,
drink it down;” and as that tired but happy
traveler laid his head on his pillow in his
cherished home, there came softly, musically,
gratefully to his ears, from some distant quarter
of the campus, the old familiar good-night song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Sweet dreams, Sammy, sweet dreams, Sammy, sweet dreams, Sammy,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">We’re going to leave you now.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Merrily we roll along,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">O’er the deep blue sea.”<br /></span>
